<p>The MySQL Connect conference is a great opportunity to listen to and chat with people from the MySQL community &#8211; including the engineers who work on or around MySQL as well people who are using it in production. The conference takes place from 21-23 September in San Francisco (runs up to Oracle OpenWorld). There are 84 sessions scheduled and the <a title="MySQL Connect 2013 content catalog" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/search.ww?eventRef=mysqlconnect#loadSearch-event=null&amp;searchPhrase=&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;p=&amp;i(11180)=20802" target="_blank">content catalog</a> has now been published.</p>

In this session, discover the latest developments and how MySQL Cluster 7.3 enables developers to focus on building robust, scalable applications faster. Get your database up and running in minutes by using the browser-based autoinstaller, combining autodiscovery with best practices to deliver the ideal configuration the first time. Migrate existing applications and frameworks to MySQL Cluster, and simplify new ones by exploiting cross-shard foreign keys. Access your data directly with the native driver for JavaScript/Node.js. At the same time, enjoy the benefits of 99.999 percent uptime and a distributed, autosharded database that scales to deliver higher loads than ever whether with SQL or NoSQL APIs—even when you’re working with queries and updates that span shards.</li>

This session aims to tackle a few myths head-on: “Installing a distributed database has to be complex,” “Only NoSQL data stores make life easy for developers,” “Years of painful experience and a PhD are needed to configure a distributed, real-time database.” In this session, see for yourself how to configure and deploy MySQL Cluster over several hosts in just minutes—right from your browser. Observe how the MySQL Cluster Installer applies best practices to produce a tailored configuration, using your hints about your application together with autodiscovery of the system resources. Also see how MySQL Cluster Manager simplifies the management of your cluster, performing sophisticated operations such as adding new nodes or performing online upgrades with ease.</li>

<p>The sessions I&#8217;ll be involved with are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=8978&#038;tclass=popup" title="MySQL Cluster: From Zero to One Billion in Five Easy Steps" target="_blank">MySQL Cluster &#8211; From Zero to One Billion in Five Easy Steps</a></strong>: Of course it takes more than five steps to scale to more than one billion queries per minute, but the new configuration features of MySQL Cluster make it much simpler to provision and deploy MySQL Cluster on-premises or in the cloud, automatically optimized for your target use case. This BoF session is designed to give you a demo of the new features, showing how you can use them to quickly build your own proof of concept and then take that into production. The MySQL Cluster Engineering team will be on hand to answer your questions and also listen to the requirements you have for current or future MySQL Cluster projects. This is Birds-of-a-Feather session and is part of the MySQL Connect conference.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=9343&#038;tclass=popup" title="Developing High-Throughput Services with NoSQL APIs to InnoDB and MySQL Cluster" target="_blank">Developing High-Throughput Services with NoSQL APIs to InnoDB and MySQL Cluster</a></strong>: Ever-increasing performance demands of Web-based services have generated significant interest in providing NoSQL access methods to MySQL (MySQL Cluster from Oracle and the InnoDB storage engine of MySQL), enabling users to maintain all the advantages of their existing relational databases while providing blazing-fast performance for simple queries. Get the best of both worlds: persistence; consistency; rich SQL queries; high availability; scalability; and simple, flexible APIs and schemas for agile development. This session describes the memcached connectors and examines some use cases for how MySQL and memcached fit together in application architectures. It does the same for the newest MySQL Cluster native connector, an easy-to-use, fully asynchronous connector for Node.js. This is a conference session and is part of the MySQL Connect conference.
</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=9731&#038;tclass=popup" title="Introduction to MySQL High-Availability Solutions" target="_blank">Introduction to MySQL High-Availability Solutions</a></strong>: Databases are the center of today’s Web and enterprise applications, storing and protecting an organization’s most valuable assets and supporting business-critical applications. Just minutes of downtime can result in dissatisfied customers and significant loss of revenue. Ensuring database high availability is therefore a top priority for any organization. Attend this session to learn more about delivering high availability for MySQL-based services. It covers</p>
<ul>
<li>The cause, effect, and impact of downtime</li>
<li>A methodology for mapping applications to the right high-availability solution</li>
<li>An overview of MySQL high availability, from replication to virtualization, clustering, and multisite redundancy</li>
<li>Operational best practices to ensure business continuity</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a conference session and is part of Oracle OpenWorld.
