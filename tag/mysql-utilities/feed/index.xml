This post will focus on a very important change (the ability to run as a daemon rather than in a terminal) to the <span style="color: #008080;">mysqlfailover </span>utility which allows you to build a light-weight HA database solution using MySQL Replication.</p>
<p>For a general overview of MySQL Utilities, <a title="MySQL Utilities Webinar – Q&amp;A + replay" href="./../../mysql/mysql-utilities-webinar-qa-replay-now-available/index.html" target="_blank">take a look at this recent webinar</a> or for a deeper dive into using them to setup replication and adding auto-failover of the master function to slaves <a title="Replication and auto-failover made easy with MySQL Utilities" href="./../../mysql/replication-and-auto-failover-made-easy-with-mysql-utilities/index.html" target="_blank">watch this video and worked example</a>.</p>
<p>When we first released the <span style="color: #008080;">mysqlfailover</span> utility, the reaction was very positive but the feedback also told us that to really use this to provide High Availability in a production system two enhancements were critical:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ability to not have the database password visible when someone queries the status of the process (for example, using the <span style="color: #008080;">ps</span> command). This was addressed by allowing the connection string to be specified using a <span style="color: #008080;">login-path</span> (referring to an entry in .mylogin.cnf &#8211; see <a title="Setting up .mylogin.cnf using  mysql_config_editor utility" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-config-editor.html" target="_blank">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-config-editor.html</a>) in place of <span style="color: #008080;">&lt;user&gt;[:&lt;passwd&gt;]@&lt;host&gt;</span>. This is a vital security enhancement added in MySQL Utilities 1.3.1.</li>
<li>Allowing <span style="color: #008080;">mysqlfailover</span> to be run as a daemon rather than being tied to the terminal from where it had to be manually launched. This option is key to enabling the user to build a reslient HA system that doesn&#8217;t rely on mysqlfailover being launched from a terminal and that terminal then never going away.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of this post focuses on how to run <span style="color: #008080;">mysqlfailover</span> as a daemon.</p>
<p>By default, <span style="color: #008080;">mysqlfailover </span>runs as an interactive program within the terminal it was run from; it constantly refreshes, providing a summary of the status of the replication topology as shown below.</p>

</span></pre>
<p>To run <span style="color: #008080;">mysqlfailover</span> as a daemon, the first new command-line option you must provide is <span style="color: #008080;">&#8211;daemon=start</span>; as you&#8217;d expect this runs the process as a daemon. In this mode, you won&#8217;t get to see the output from <span style="color: #008080;">mysqlfailover</span> at your terminal and so you should make sure that you know what log file is being used &#8211; so it&#8217;s best to specify it with <span style="color: #008080;">&#8211;log=&lt;path-to-log-file&gt;</span>. You can also control what information is periodically written to the log file using <span style="color: #008080;">&#8211;report-values=&lt;list-of-attributes from health,gtid,uuid&gt;</span>.  As you&#8217;ll likely to want to be able to manage the daemon without having to be in the same directory (and also likely to manage it from scripts that are automatically run when the server starts and stops) it makes sense to specify where the process ID file should be stored using <span style="color: #008080;">&#8211;pid=&lt;path-to-pid-file&gt;</span>.</p>
<p>The final incantation might look something like the following:</p>
<pre><span style="color: #008080;">mysqlfailover --master=root@192.168.1.101:5001 
  --discover-slaves-login=root 
  --rediscover 
  --log=/home/mysql/servers/mysqlfailover.log 
  --pidfile=/home/mysql/servers/mysqlfailover.pid 
  --daemon=start 
  --report-values=health,gtid,uuid
</span></pre>
<p>and the resulting log file could then contain information such as this:</p>
<pre><span style="color: #008080;">2013-08-02 01:10:34 AM INFO Getting health for master: 192.168.1.101:5001.

<p>As you&#8217;d expect, you can also stop the daemon:</p>
<pre><span style="color: #008080;">mysqlfailover 
    --log=/home/mysql/servers/mysqlfailover.log 
    --pidfile=/home/mysql/servers/mysqlfailover.pid 
    --daemon=stop
</span></pre>
<p>and restart it:</p>
<pre><span style="color: #008080;">mysqlfailover 
    --log=/home/mysql/servers/mysqlfailover.log 
    --pidfile=/home/mysql/servers/mysqlfailover.pid 
    --daemon=restart
</span></pre>
<p>The final option for <span style="color: #008080;">daemon=</span> is <span style="color: #008080;">daemon=nodetach</span> which is like start but the terminal that it&#8217;s run from will continue to view the output from the daemon.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that when the server is restarted, <span style="color: #008080;">mysqlfailover</span> needs to be started again and this is not something that is automatically configured when you run it as a daemon &#8211; rather, it&#8217;s your responsibility to ensure that it&#8217;s restarted (for example, including it in an <span style="color: #008080;">init</span> script.</p>
<p>Please try it out and (as always) let us know how you get on &#8211; the addition of these extra options is a direct result of the user feedback received for the earlier versions.</p>

<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>MySQL Utilities provide a collection of command-line utilities that are used for maintaining and administering MySQL databases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admin Utilities (Clone, Copy, Compare, Diff, Export, Import)</li>
<li>Replication Utilities (Setup, Configuration, Automated Slave Promotion)</li>
<li>General Utilities (Disk Usage, Redundant Indexes, Search Meta Data)</li>
</ul>
<p>Andrew Morgan and Chuck Bell will guide you through these utilities, and many more, explaining what you can gain from these tools and how to use them (for example how a single command repeatedly checks your master server and in the event it fails, automatically promotes one of the slaves to be the new master).</p>
<h3>Question &amp; Answer Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using these utilities, can we export/import routines&#8217; source as well?</strong> Yes.</li>
<li><strong>I generally run multi-master behind a proxy (haproxy). I was wondering if the replication check would work. But I guess mysql still does not support multi-master or ring replcation.</strong> It depends on want you intend to do exactly. There are some limitation, but we intend to improve the utilities over time. So, just test the utilities on your environment and your are welcome to share your feedback with us.</li>
<li><strong>Do you need the python connector if you have the utilities on workbench?</strong> No, it is bundled as part of WB.</li>
<li><strong>What does &#8220;mysqluserclone&#8221; do that &#8220;SHOW GRANTS FOR USER&#8221; doesn&#8217;t do?</strong> It actually creates the users, clone them and not simply show its privileges like SHOW GRANTS. You can find more details <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/mysqluserclone.html" title="mysqluserclone manual" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>With mysqlfailover can I set a sequence to swith specific order if a fail occurs with the master?</strong>  Yes, you can. It will follow the sequence of the defined candidates.</li>
<li><strong>Can I run mysqlfailover on a independent server that check the master and their slave servers or it can run on the master or slave servers (mandatory)?</strong> Running on an independent server is ideal. After all, you don&#8217;t want it to disappear when the master&#8217;s host fails.</li>
<li><strong>How many MySQL instances can I manage with mysqlfailover, I mean there is possible to check more than one array with the same independent server?</strong> With one mysqlfailover instance you can monitor one topology, i.e. one master and all its slaves. If you have more than one topology (using a different master) you can use a mysqlfailover instance to monitor each one.
</li>
<li><strong>If a master goes down and replication failover is successful, how hard is it to bring that old master back into the fold, assuming it was just a network disruption?</strong> You can use mysqlreplicate to set the old master as a slave of the new master resulted by the failover, that will update the old master. then you can use mysqlrpladmin to switchover the just added slave, to make it a master again, that back your original replication setup.</li>
<li><strong>Can mysqlprocgrep log what it kills?</strong> There is no option to log what it is done. But you can redirect the utility output if it contains the information you need.</li>
<li><strong>How does mysqldbcompare handle auto-increment columns?</strong> It will find the difference between auto_increment values. So, currently if it is different it will identify the difference. You will get the difference, as: changed or missing rows are shown in a standard format of GRID, CSV, TAB, or VERTICAL. you can choose in which format you want to get the difference.</li>
<li><strong>I use Pacemaker/Corosync to achieve failover. Is mysqlfailover suitable for use in that context? Do I need to add extra logic around it, some wrapper script? If so, does Oracle provide a ready-made scripts for Pacemaker/Corosync?</strong> mysqlfailover was designed to work independently, and provides some functionalities that may help with the integration with other systems (like the possibility to execute external pre- pos- failover scripts). We do not have a ready-made script for Pacemaker/Corosync. For more information <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/mysqlfailover.html" title="mysqlfailover manual" target="_blank">check here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>How long are the frm files kept if the database is corrupt or was deleted.</strong> The .frm files are not removed in any way. So there is no deletion or removal of the .frm files. The .frm files are an integral part of the server and stored in the datadir.</li>
<li><strong>Can mysqlserverclone clone instances between separate servers? Using SSH?</strong> mysqlserverclone, starts a new instance, that mimics a running server or a offline server by taking a look to his configuration, but to copy objects like tables, to another instance you need to use mysqldbcopy. We do not currently support SSH. If you see this as a much needed feature, please open a feature request via bugs.mysql.com. That will help us understand the need and urgency.</li>

As well as listening to the presentation, this is a great chance to get your questions answered by the experts (Israel Gomez from the engineering team will also be on-line to help with the questions). As always, the webinar is free but you should <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/focus-on-mysql-utilities/" title="MySQL Utilities webinar - registration" target="_blank">register in advance here</a>. If the time isn&#8217;t convenient, register anyway and you&#8217;ll be sent a link to the replay when it&#8217;s available.</p>
<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>MySQL Utilities provide a collection of command-line utilities that are used for maintaining and administering MySQL databases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admin Utilities (Clone, Copy, Compare, Diff, Export, Import)</li>
<li>Replication Utilities (Setup, Configuration, Automated Slave Promotion)</li>
<li>General Utilities (Disk Usage, Redundant Indexes, Search Meta Data)</li>
</ul>
<p>Andrew Morgan and Chuck Bell will guide you through these utilities, and many more, explaining what you can gain from these tools and how to use them (for example how a single command repeatedly checks your master server and in the event it fails, automatically promotes one of the slaves to be the new master). This is your opportunity to listen to the development lead describe what he and his team have created, and to get your questions answered by the experts.</p>
