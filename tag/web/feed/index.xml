										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mat Keep and I will be presenting this free webinar on Wednesday 14 July. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mysql-cluster-logo-150x105.png"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-919" title="mysql-cluster-logo-150x105" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mysql-cluster-logo-150x105.png" alt="" width="150" height="105" /></a></p>
<p>The MEMORY storage engine has been widely adopted by MySQL users to provide near-instant responsiveness with use cases such as caching and web session management. As these services evolve to support more users, so the scalability and availability demands can start to exceed the capabilities of the MEMORY storage engine.</p>
<p>The MySQL Cluster database, which itself can be implemented as a MySQL storage engine, is a viable alternative to address these evolving web service demands. MySQL Cluster can be configured and run in the same way as the MEMORY storage engine (ie on a single host with no replication and no persistence). As web services evolve, any of these attributes can then be added in any combination to deliver higher levels of scalability, availability and database functionality, especially for those workloads which predominately access data by the primary key.</p>
<p>As always, the webinar is free of charge but you will need to <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/display-551.html" target="_blank">register here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The replay of this webinar is now available from <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/on-demand-webinars/display-od-545.html" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/on-demand-webinars/display-od-545.html</a></p>
<p>MySQL and memcached has become, and will remain, the foundation for many dynamic web services with proven deployments in some of the largest and most prolific names on the web. There are classes of web services however that are update-intensive, demanding real-time responsiveness and continuous availability. In these cases, MySQL Cluster provides the familiarity and ease-of-use of the regular MySQL Server, while delivering significantly higher levels of write performance with less complexity, lower latency and 99.999% availability. This webinar will discuss the use-cases for both approaches, and provide an insight into how MySQL Cluster is enabling users to scale their update-intensive web services.</p>
<p>The webinar starts at 09:00 Pacific/17:00 UK/18:00 CET today (June 9th 2010).</p>
<p>Still time to register (for free) at <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/display-545.html" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/display-545.html</a> &#8211; even if you can&#8217;t attend, this way you&#8217;ll get sent a link to the charts and replay.</p>
