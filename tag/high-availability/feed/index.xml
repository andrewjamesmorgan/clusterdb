<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>MySQL Cluster powers the subscriber databases of major communication services providers as well as next generation web, cloud, social and mobile applications. It is designed to deliver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time, in-memory performance for both OLTP and analytics workloads</li>
<li>Linear scale-out for both reads and writes</li>
<li>99.999% High Availability</li>
<li>Transparent, cross-shard transactions and joins</li>
<li>Update-Anywhere Geographic replication</li>
<li>SQL or native NoSQL APIs</li>
<li>All that while still providing full ACID transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understand some of the highlights of MySQL Cluster 7.4:</p>
<ul>
<li>200 Million queries per minute</li>
<li>Active-Active geographic replication with conflict detection and resolution</li>
<li>5x faster on-line maintenance activities</li>
<li>Enhanced reporting for memory and database operations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can all data be stored on disk rather than in memory?</strong> Any column that isn&#8217;t part of an index can be stored on disk if you want it to be. There is then an in-memory cache for the disk-based data.</li>
<li><strong>Is in-memory data safe from the whole system shutting down (e.g. power loss for the whole data center)?</strong> The in-memory data is (asynchronously) checkpointed to disk (so that there is persistence but latency isn&#8217;t impacted).</li>
<li><strong>I need to store more than 14K non BLOB/TEXT data in a single row &#8211; has this been addressed?</strong> As you say the options are to use TEXT/BLOB columns (or of course to split the data over multiple rows).</li>
<li><strong>Can you comment on improvements of virtualized deploymets regarding the 7.4 version?</strong> Only to say that more and more people are deploying on VMs and we&#8217;re not seeing issues caused &#8211; if we do then they&#8217;ll be fixed</li>
<li><strong>Can I upgrage from the previous version (7.3) to MySQL Cluster 7.4 or do I have to reinstall the product of the new version (7.4)?</strong> You can perform a rolling upgarade from MySQL Cluster 7.3 to MySQL Cluster 7.4 &#8211; the database stays uo throughout the process and you don&#8217;t lose any data or have to stop writing changes.</li>
</ul>

The <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/sql-nosql-the-best-of-both-worlds-with-mysql-cluster/" title="NoSQL and SQL, The Best of Both Worlds" target="_blank"> webinar replay is now available to view here</a>.</p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of excitement about NoSQL data stores, with the promise of simple access patterns, flexible schemas, scalability, and high availability. The downside comes in the form of losing ACID transactions, consistency, flexible queries, and data integrity checks. What if you could have the best of both worlds? Join this webinar to learn how MySQL Cluster provides simultaneous SQL and native NoSQL access to your data—whether it’s in a simple key-value API (memcached) or REST, JavaScript, Java, or C++. You will hear how the MySQL Cluster architecture delivers in-memory real-time performance; 99.999 percent availability; online maintenance; and linear, horizontal scalability through transparent autosharding.</p>

<p>The <a title="Achieving MySQL High Availability, Learn to Select Your Best Option - webinar replay" href="https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&amp;eventid=930247&amp;sessionid=1&amp;key=FF21049401BAD50579B6733B15BC9D36&amp;sourcepage=register" target="_blank">replay of this webinar can now be viewed here</a> or if you just want to look at the charts then scroll down. At the end of this post, I include a summary of the Q&amp;A from the webinar.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">How important is your data? Can you afford to lose it? What about just some of it? What would be the impact if you couldn&#8217;t access it for a minute, an hour, a day or a week?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Different applications can have very different requirements for High Availability. Some need 100% data reliability with 24x7x365 read &amp; write access while many others are better served by a simpler approach with more modest HA ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">MySQL has an array of High Availability solutions ranging from simple backups, through replication and shared storage clustering &#8211; all the way up to 99.999% available shared nothing, geographically replicated clusters. These solutions also have different &#8216;bonus&#8217; features such as full InnoDB compatibility, in-memory real-time performance, linear scalability and SQL &amp; NoSQL APIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">The purpose of this webinar is to help you decide where your application sits in terms of HA requirements and discover which of the MySQL solutions best fit the bill. It will also cover what you need outside of the database to ensure High Availability &#8211; state of the art monitoring being a prime example.</span></p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>What does &#8220;HA&#8221; stands for?</strong> High Availability</li>
<li><strong>What is meant by scale-out?</strong> Scale-out is where you increase the capacity or the throughput of the system by adding extra (usually commodity) machines &#8211; this is the opposite of scale-up where you buy the biggest single server that you can find. It tends to be much more economical this way and you can add extra capacity if and when you need it.</li>
<li><strong>Most of my applications are for small businesses were the data load is not that big, is this session worth listening too?</strong> Yes &#8211; the focus of this presentation is on keeping your data safe and accessible, not on scaling to massive volumes and throughput. Scale-out is touched on as if you need that as well then it can influence your choice of High Availability solution</li>
<li><strong>How does all this compare with Amazon Aurora?</strong> Aurora is something that&#8217;s offered by Amazon and is supported by them. Aurora can only be run on AWS &#8211; the solutions covered here can be taken to lots of different environments &#8211; whether cloud or &#8216;bare metal&#8217;</li>
<li><strong>what amount of work would be involved in migrating actual InnoDB based DB&#8217;s into NDB?</strong> As you&#8217;d expect, it depends on the application. Changes should be minor to get it to run but you might need to make more adjustments to get the best performance. This <a title="MySQL Cluster Evaluation Guide" href="http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/white-papers/mysql-cluster-evaluation-guide/" target="_blank">white paper</a> is a good place to start.</li>
<li><strong>Is it possible to migrate InnoDB data to MySQL Cluster?</strong> Yes. The first thing to note is that to use MySQL Cluster, you have to use the mysqld (MySQL Server) process that comes with the MySQL Cluster package; once you&#8217;ve switched to that binary then you can run ALTER TABLE my_tab ENGINE=NDB; provided that your schema is compatible with MySQL Cluster. Alternatively you can perform a mysqldump and then load the data in.</li>
<li><strong>Does MySQL Fabric solutions support &#8220;rolling upgrade&#8221;?</strong> Yes &#8211; you can perform a rolling upgrade of the managed MySQL Servers but you have to do it yourself, Fabric doesn&#8217;t automate it at present</li>
<li><strong>What about master-master replication?</strong> You can use active-active replication but the application is responsibe for avoiding conflicts between the two sites unless you use MySQL Cluster/NDB (where the functionality is built into the database)</li>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s the maximum distance that the master and slave can be apart?</strong> For MySQL Replication, there is no maximum distance; the latency of the master isn&#8217;t impacted if you stick with the default asynchronous replication. If you use semi-synchronous replication then the latency of your transactions will be impacted by the WAN latency between the master and slave site(s).</li>
<li><strong>Is there a monetary investment to implement this or is it free?</strong> The database technology presented in this session can be used under the GPL open source license; if you buy a commercal edition then you get access to some additional tools such as MySQL Enterprise Monitor and MySQL Cluster Manager.</li>
<li><strong>Can we check the transaction sequence in slave side?</strong> Yes, with MySQL replication, you can check which transactions have been applied on the slave.</li>
<li><strong>Can the slave switch over to master, in case the master needs to be shut down?</strong> Yes &#8211; that&#8217;s a very common use case</li>
<li><strong>Do we have seperate binlog for different databases (schemas)?</strong> All of the databases (schemas) within the MySQL Server use the same binary log. When that log file fills up, it&#8217;s rotated out and a new one used.</li>
<li><strong>How can I implement &#8220;auto-failover&#8221; in mysql 5.6 replication? Are you talking abaout &#8220;mysqlfailover&#8221; script?</strong> You can use the mysqlfailover utility or MySQL Fabric</li>
<li><strong>What are the similarties and differences between InnoDB and the NDB/MySQL Cluster engines?</strong> We&#8217;ll cover some of this in this presentation and you can find more details in this <a title="MySQL Cluster Evaluation Guide" href="http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/white-papers/mysql-cluster-evaluation-guide/" target="_blank">white paper</a></li>
<li><strong>With master-master replication, there were some parameters to control the autoincrement IDs so that we could avoid conflicts with active-active MySQL replication?</strong> If you ensure that the same row isn&#8217;t written to on both masters then you can avoid conflicts. One option could be to store odd primary keys on one and even on the other. You can then set the <a title="auto_increment_increment" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-options-master.html#sysvar_auto_increment_increment" target="_blank">auto_increment_increment</a> and <a title="auto_increment_offset" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-options-master.html#sysvar_auto_increment_offset" target="_blank">auto_increment_offset</a> parameters and then use auto-increment primary keys on each MySQL Server</li>
<li><strong>Is there an online backup tool available in mysql &#8211; without locking my database?</strong> Yes &#8211; if you&#8217;re using InnoDB then you can use MySQL Enterprise Backup (part of MySQL Enterprise Edition and it&#8217;s also <em>much</em> faster than mysqldump); MySQL Cluster it has a built-in online backup tool (which can be simpler to use in conjunction with MySQL Cluter Manager which is part of MySQL Cluster Carrier Grade Edition)</li>
<li><strong>In multi-source replication, how are data conflicts handled? If more than one master modifies the same row, which one is applied?</strong> That&#8217;s left as an exercise for the application. The application is responsible for making sure that there are no conflicting updates (if you care about the conflicts). You could also use MySQL Fabric to shard the data.</li>
<li><strong>With MySQL Group Replication, if one master is down, will transactions still be applied?</strong> With MySQL Group Replication, updates can be sent to any of the servers and so if one is unavailable just switch to any of the others</li>
<li><strong>what is the maximum data size MySQL can handle in it&#8217;s latest release?</strong> The maximum size of an InnoDB table[space] is four billion pages (64TB with the default 16k page size). Beyond that you start partitioning or use MySQL Fabric</li>
<li><strong>Can you give a short definition for sharding?</strong> Sharding is where you take the data for a table and split it accross multiple MySQL Server instances. Typically you&#8217;ll choose one or more columns from the table to act as the sharding key to decide which shard a specific row should be stored in. You can also have functional sharding where you decide that the whole of table A will be in one shard and all of table B in another</li>
<li><strong>Is there a storage engine to handle JSON documents?</strong> Here&#8217;s an <a title="JSON queries using MySQL" href="interesting blog on that topic. http://blog.ulf-wendel.de/2013/mysql-5-7-sql-functions-for-json-udf/" target="_blank">interesting blog on that topic</a></li>
<li><strong>What algorithms are available for sharding in MySQL?</strong> With MySQL Fabric you can use a hash or define ranges for the shard key. With MySQL Cluster, the sharding is completely transparrent to the application but it uses a MD5 hashing under the covers</li>
<li><strong>In MySQL cluster is all the data replicated to all of the data nodes?</strong> Data is synchrously replicated between the 2 data nodes forming a node group. Different node groups are responsible for different shards for any given table</li>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s the maximum number of data nodes in MySQL Cluster?</strong> 48</li>
<li><strong>Which it best inter-connect method between MySQL Cluster data nodes for highest performance?</strong> Infiniband and GB Ethernet have both shown great results. If you&#8217;re able to configure the behaviour then low latency will help get the best performance</li>
<li><strong>Can I colocate MySQL Cluster data nodes with MySQL Servers in order use all posible resources?</strong> Yes, you can co-locate data nodes and MySQL Servers. Note that the management node (ndb_mgmd) should not run on the same machine as any of the data nodes &#8211; <a title="read this post for details on how to deploy MySQL Cluster nodes for High Availability" href="/mysql-cluster/mysql-cluster-fault-tolerance-impact-of-deployment-decisions" target="_blank">read this post for details on how to deploy MySQL Cluster nodes for High Availability</a></li>

<p>As always, the webinar is free but you should <a title="Register for free webinar - Achieving MySQL High Availability, Learn to Select Your Best Option" href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/achieving-mysql-ha-learn-to-select-best-option/" target="_blank">register here</a>. Even if you can&#8217;t attend, it&#8217;s worth registering as you&#8217;ll be sent a link to the replay as soon as it&#8217;s available.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">How important is your data? Can you afford to lose it? What about just some of it? What would be the impact if you couldn&#8217;t access it for a minute, an hour, a day or a week?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Different applications can have very different requirements for High Availability. Some need 100% data reliability with 24x7x365 read &amp; write access while many others are better served by a simpler approach with more modest HA ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">MySQL has an array of High Availability solutions ranging from simple backups, through replication and shared storage clustering &#8211; all the way up to 99.999% available shared nothing, geographically replicated clusters. These solutions also have different &#8216;bonus&#8217; features such as full InnoDB compatibility, in-memory real-time performance, linear scalability and SQL &amp; NoSQL APIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">The purpose of this webinar is to help you decide where your application sits in terms of HA requirements and discover which of the MySQL solutions best fit the bill. It will also cover what you need outside of the database to ensure High Availability &#8211; state of the art monitoring being a prime example.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend I got to present to the MySQL Developers Room at FOSDEM in Brussels.<br />
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/FOSDEM-2015.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/FOSDEM-2015.jpg" alt="FOSDEM-2015" width="184" height="176" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4001" /></a><br />
The subject of my presentation was <strong>NoSQL and SQL the best of both worlds</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>There’s a lot of excitement around NoSQL Data Stores with the promise of simple access patterns, flexible schemas, scalability and High Availability. The downside comes in the form of losing ACID transactions, consistency, flexible queries and data integrity checks. What if you could have the best of both worlds? This session shows how MySQL Cluster provides simultaneous SQL and native NoSQL access to your data – whether a simple key-value API (Memcached), REST, JavaScript, Java or C++. You will hear how the MySQL Cluster architecture delivers in-memory real-time performance, 99.999% availability, on-line maintenance and linear, horizontal scalability through transparent auto-sharding.</p>

<p>Oracle have just made availble the new MySQL Cluster 7.4.1 Development Milestone Release &#8211; it can be <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/" title="download the MySQL Cluster 7.4.1 Development Milestone Release" target="_blank">downloaded from the development release tab here</a>. Note that this is not a GA release and so we wouldn&#8217;t recommend using it in production.</p>
<p>There are three main focus areas for this DMR and the purpose of this post is to briefly introduce them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active-Active (Multi-Master) Replication</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Operational improvements (speeding up of restarts; enhanced memory reporting)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Active-Active (Multi-Master) Replication</h2>
<p>MySQL Cluster allows bi-directional replication between two (or more) clusters. Replication within each cluster is synchronous but between clusters it is asynchronous which means the following scenario is possible:</p>
<table summary="Active-Active asynchronous replication can lead to inconsistencies between databases" width="260" border="1" align="center">
<caption align="center">Conflict with asynchronous replication</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col" align="center" width="80">Site A</th>
<th scope="col" align="center" width="100">Replication</th>
<th scope="col" align="center" width="80">Site B</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">x == 10</td>
<td></td>
<td align="center">x == 10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">x = 11</td>
<td></td>
<td align="center">x = 20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align="center">&#8212; x=11 &#8211;&gt;</td>
<td align="center">x == 11</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">x==20</td>
<td align="center">&lt;&#8211; x=20 &#8212;</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this example a value (column for a row in a table) is set to 11 on site A and the change is queued for replication to site B. In the mean time, an application sets the value to 20 on site B and that change is queued for replication to site A. Once both sites have received and applied the replicated change from the other cluster site A contains the value 20 while site B contains 11 &#8211; in other words the databases are now inconsistent.</p>
<h2>How MySQL Cluster implements eventual consistency</h2>
<p>There are two phases to establishing consistency between both clusters after an inconsistency has been introduced:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detect that a conflict has happened</li>
<li>Resolve the inconsistency</li>
</ol>
<p>The following animation illustrates how MySQL Cluster 7.2 detects that an inconsistency has been introduced by the asynchronous, active-active replication:</p>
<div id="attachment_2149" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ReflectingGCI1.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149" class="size-full wp-image-2149" title="ReflectingGCI" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ReflectingGCI1.gif" alt="" width="600" height="463" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2149" class="wp-caption-text">Detecting conflicts</p></div>
<p>While we typically consider the 2 clusters in an active-active replication configuration to be peers, in this case we designate one to be the primary and the other the secondary. Reads and writes can still be sent to either cluster but it is the responsibility of the primary to identify that a conflict has arisen and then remove the inconsistency.</p>
<p>A logical clock is used to identify (in relative terms) when a change is made on the primary &#8211; for those who know something of the MySQL Cluster internals, we use the index of the Global Checkpoint that the update is contained in. For all tables that have this feature turned on, an extra, hidden column is automatically added on the primary &#8211; this represents the value of the logical clock when the change was made.</p>
<p>Once the change has been applied on the primary, there is a &#8220;window of conflict&#8221; for the effected row(s) during which if a different change is made to the same row(s) on the secondary then there will be an inconsistency. Once the slave on the secondary has applied the change from the primary, it will send a replication event back to the slave on the primary, containing the primary&#8217;s clock value associated with the changes that have just been applied on the secondary. (Remember that the clock is actually the Global Checkpoint Index and so this feature is sometimes referred to as Reflected GCI). Once the slave on the primary has received this event, it knows that all changes tagged with a clock value no later than the reflected GCI are now safe &#8211; the window of conflict has closed.</p>
<p>If an application modifies this same row on the secondary before the replication event from the primary was applied then it will send an associated replication event to the slave on the primary <strong>before</strong> it reflects the new GCI. The slave on the primary will process this replication event and compare the clock value recorded with the effected rows with the latest reflected GCI; as the clock value for the conflicting row is higher the primary recognises that a conflict has occured and will launch the algorithm to resolve the inconsistency.</p>

<p>After a conflict has been detected, you have the option of having the database simply report the conflict to the application or have it roll back just the conflicting row or the entire transaction and all subsequent transactions that were dependent on it.</p>
<p>So &#8211; what&#8217;s new in 7.4.1?</p>
<ul>
<li>Detects conflicts between inserts and updates</li>
<li>Option to roll back entire transaction (and dependent transactions) rather than just the conflicting row</li>
<li>All conflicts are handled before switching primary &#8211; avoiding potential race conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned at the start of this post, this is pre-GA and there are some extra enhancements we plan on including in the final version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle deletes which conflict with other operations</li>
<li>Roll back transactions that have <strong>read</strong> a row that had been rolled back due to a conflict</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance</h3>

Being a scaled-out, in-memory, real-time database, MySQL Cluster performance has always been great but we continue to work on making it faster each release. In particular, we want to keep pace with the trend of having more and more cores rather than faster ones. 7.4 continues along the path of better exploiting multiple cores &#8211; as can be seen from these benchmark results.<br />
<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-25-at-13.35.15.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-25-at-13.35.15-300x199.png" alt="MySQL CLuster 7.4.1 Read Performance" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3951" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-25-at-13.35.15-300x199.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-25-at-13.35.15.png 842w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
Just make sure that you&#8217;re using the multi-threaded data node (ndbmtd rather than ndbd) and have <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-programs-ndbmtd.html" title="MySQL Cluster - configuring multi-threaded datanodes" target="_blank">configured how many threads it should use</a>.</p>
<h3>Faster Restarts</h3>
<p>You can restart MySQL Cluster processes (nodes) without losing database service (for example if adding extra memory to a server) and so on the face of it, the speed of the restarts isn&#8217;t that important. Having said that, while the node is restarting you&#8217;ve lost some of your high-availability which for super-critical applications can make you nervous. Additionally, faster restarts mean that you can complete maintenance activities faster &#8211; for example, a software upgrade requires a rolling restart of all of the nodes &#8211; if you have 48 data nodes then you want each of the data nodes to restart as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>MySQL 7.4.1 includes a number of optimisations to the restart code and so if you&#8217;re already using MySQL Cluster, it might be interesting to see how much faster it gets for your application. We also have some extra optimisations in the works that you can expect to see in later 7.4 versions.</p>
<h3>Extra Memory Reporting</h3>
<p>MySQL Cluster presents a lot of monitoring information through the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-ndbinfo.html" title="ndbinfo database" target="_blank">ndbinfo database</a> and in 7.4 we&#8217;ve added some extra information on how memory is used for individual tables.</p>
<p>For example; to see how much memory is being used by each data node for a particular table&#8230;</p>

<p>When you delete rows from a MySQL Cluster table, the memory is not actually freed up and so if you check the existing <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-ndbinfo-memoryusage.html" title="memoryusage table" target="_blank">memoryusage table</a> you won&#8217;t see a change. This memory will be reused when you add new rows to that same table. In MySQL Cluster 7.4, it&#8217;s possible to see how much memory is in that state for a table&#8230;</p>
