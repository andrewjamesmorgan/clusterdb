					<description><![CDATA[Hi Andrew,
       Started  mysqlfailover utility as a daemon and it monitor for some time and stops working after some time. However, I see the linux level process was still active including the pid file available, but not failing over. Is the mysqlfailover suppose to run in the background if it starts as a daemon? 

Command to start the failover

mysqlfailover --verbose --master=root@10.52.201.11 --discover-slaves-login=root --failover-mode=auto  --candidates=root@10.52.201.101,root@10.206.75.34 --daemon=start --log=mysqlfailover.log --pidfile=failover_daemon.pid

When I brought down the master, mysqlfailover is not detecting the failure and no activities from mysqlfailover utility.  

Master and slave are running with mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.23, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper.

Any clue to trouble shoot the issue?]]></description>
