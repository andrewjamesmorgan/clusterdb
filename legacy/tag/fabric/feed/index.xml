<p>The <a title="Achieving MySQL High Availability, Learn to Select Your Best Option - webinar replay" href="https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&amp;eventid=930247&amp;sessionid=1&amp;key=FF21049401BAD50579B6733B15BC9D36&amp;sourcepage=register" target="_blank">replay of this webinar can now be viewed here</a> or if you just want to look at the charts then scroll down. At the end of this post, I include a summary of the Q&amp;A from the webinar.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">How important is your data? Can you afford to lose it? What about just some of it? What would be the impact if you couldn&#8217;t access it for a minute, an hour, a day or a week?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Different applications can have very different requirements for High Availability. Some need 100% data reliability with 24x7x365 read &amp; write access while many others are better served by a simpler approach with more modest HA ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">MySQL has an array of High Availability solutions ranging from simple backups, through replication and shared storage clustering &#8211; all the way up to 99.999% available shared nothing, geographically replicated clusters. These solutions also have different &#8216;bonus&#8217; features such as full InnoDB compatibility, in-memory real-time performance, linear scalability and SQL &amp; NoSQL APIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">The purpose of this webinar is to help you decide where your application sits in terms of HA requirements and discover which of the MySQL solutions best fit the bill. It will also cover what you need outside of the database to ensure High Availability &#8211; state of the art monitoring being a prime example.</span></p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>What does &#8220;HA&#8221; stands for?</strong> High Availability</li>
<li><strong>What is meant by scale-out?</strong> Scale-out is where you increase the capacity or the throughput of the system by adding extra (usually commodity) machines &#8211; this is the opposite of scale-up where you buy the biggest single server that you can find. It tends to be much more economical this way and you can add extra capacity if and when you need it.</li>
<li><strong>Most of my applications are for small businesses were the data load is not that big, is this session worth listening too?</strong> Yes &#8211; the focus of this presentation is on keeping your data safe and accessible, not on scaling to massive volumes and throughput. Scale-out is touched on as if you need that as well then it can influence your choice of High Availability solution</li>
<li><strong>How does all this compare with Amazon Aurora?</strong> Aurora is something that&#8217;s offered by Amazon and is supported by them. Aurora can only be run on AWS &#8211; the solutions covered here can be taken to lots of different environments &#8211; whether cloud or &#8216;bare metal&#8217;</li>
<li><strong>what amount of work would be involved in migrating actual InnoDB based DB&#8217;s into NDB?</strong> As you&#8217;d expect, it depends on the application. Changes should be minor to get it to run but you might need to make more adjustments to get the best performance. This <a title="MySQL Cluster Evaluation Guide" href="http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/white-papers/mysql-cluster-evaluation-guide/" target="_blank">white paper</a> is a good place to start.</li>
<li><strong>Is it possible to migrate InnoDB data to MySQL Cluster?</strong> Yes. The first thing to note is that to use MySQL Cluster, you have to use the mysqld (MySQL Server) process that comes with the MySQL Cluster package; once you&#8217;ve switched to that binary then you can run ALTER TABLE my_tab ENGINE=NDB; provided that your schema is compatible with MySQL Cluster. Alternatively you can perform a mysqldump and then load the data in.</li>
<li><strong>Does MySQL Fabric solutions support &#8220;rolling upgrade&#8221;?</strong> Yes &#8211; you can perform a rolling upgrade of the managed MySQL Servers but you have to do it yourself, Fabric doesn&#8217;t automate it at present</li>
<li><strong>What about master-master replication?</strong> You can use active-active replication but the application is responsibe for avoiding conflicts between the two sites unless you use MySQL Cluster/NDB (where the functionality is built into the database)</li>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s the maximum distance that the master and slave can be apart?</strong> For MySQL Replication, there is no maximum distance; the latency of the master isn&#8217;t impacted if you stick with the default asynchronous replication. If you use semi-synchronous replication then the latency of your transactions will be impacted by the WAN latency between the master and slave site(s).</li>
<li><strong>Is there a monetary investment to implement this or is it free?</strong> The database technology presented in this session can be used under the GPL open source license; if you buy a commercal edition then you get access to some additional tools such as MySQL Enterprise Monitor and MySQL Cluster Manager.</li>
<li><strong>Can we check the transaction sequence in slave side?</strong> Yes, with MySQL replication, you can check which transactions have been applied on the slave.</li>
<li><strong>Can the slave switch over to master, in case the master needs to be shut down?</strong> Yes &#8211; that&#8217;s a very common use case</li>
<li><strong>Do we have seperate binlog for different databases (schemas)?</strong> All of the databases (schemas) within the MySQL Server use the same binary log. When that log file fills up, it&#8217;s rotated out and a new one used.</li>
<li><strong>How can I implement &#8220;auto-failover&#8221; in mysql 5.6 replication? Are you talking abaout &#8220;mysqlfailover&#8221; script?</strong> You can use the mysqlfailover utility or MySQL Fabric</li>
<li><strong>What are the similarties and differences between InnoDB and the NDB/MySQL Cluster engines?</strong> We&#8217;ll cover some of this in this presentation and you can find more details in this <a title="MySQL Cluster Evaluation Guide" href="http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/white-papers/mysql-cluster-evaluation-guide/" target="_blank">white paper</a></li>
<li><strong>With master-master replication, there were some parameters to control the autoincrement IDs so that we could avoid conflicts with active-active MySQL replication?</strong> If you ensure that the same row isn&#8217;t written to on both masters then you can avoid conflicts. One option could be to store odd primary keys on one and even on the other. You can then set the <a title="auto_increment_increment" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-options-master.html#sysvar_auto_increment_increment" target="_blank">auto_increment_increment</a> and <a title="auto_increment_offset" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-options-master.html#sysvar_auto_increment_offset" target="_blank">auto_increment_offset</a> parameters and then use auto-increment primary keys on each MySQL Server</li>
<li><strong>Is there an online backup tool available in mysql &#8211; without locking my database?</strong> Yes &#8211; if you&#8217;re using InnoDB then you can use MySQL Enterprise Backup (part of MySQL Enterprise Edition and it&#8217;s also <em>much</em> faster than mysqldump); MySQL Cluster it has a built-in online backup tool (which can be simpler to use in conjunction with MySQL Cluter Manager which is part of MySQL Cluster Carrier Grade Edition)</li>
<li><strong>In multi-source replication, how are data conflicts handled? If more than one master modifies the same row, which one is applied?</strong> That&#8217;s left as an exercise for the application. The application is responsible for making sure that there are no conflicting updates (if you care about the conflicts). You could also use MySQL Fabric to shard the data.</li>
<li><strong>With MySQL Group Replication, if one master is down, will transactions still be applied?</strong> With MySQL Group Replication, updates can be sent to any of the servers and so if one is unavailable just switch to any of the others</li>
<li><strong>what is the maximum data size MySQL can handle in it&#8217;s latest release?</strong> The maximum size of an InnoDB table[space] is four billion pages (64TB with the default 16k page size). Beyond that you start partitioning or use MySQL Fabric</li>
<li><strong>Can you give a short definition for sharding?</strong> Sharding is where you take the data for a table and split it accross multiple MySQL Server instances. Typically you&#8217;ll choose one or more columns from the table to act as the sharding key to decide which shard a specific row should be stored in. You can also have functional sharding where you decide that the whole of table A will be in one shard and all of table B in another</li>
<li><strong>Is there a storage engine to handle JSON documents?</strong> Here&#8217;s an <a title="JSON queries using MySQL" href="interesting blog on that topic. http://blog.ulf-wendel.de/2013/mysql-5-7-sql-functions-for-json-udf/" target="_blank">interesting blog on that topic</a></li>
<li><strong>What algorithms are available for sharding in MySQL?</strong> With MySQL Fabric you can use a hash or define ranges for the shard key. With MySQL Cluster, the sharding is completely transparrent to the application but it uses a MD5 hashing under the covers</li>
<li><strong>In MySQL cluster is all the data replicated to all of the data nodes?</strong> Data is synchrously replicated between the 2 data nodes forming a node group. Different node groups are responsible for different shards for any given table</li>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s the maximum number of data nodes in MySQL Cluster?</strong> 48</li>
<li><strong>Which it best inter-connect method between MySQL Cluster data nodes for highest performance?</strong> Infiniband and GB Ethernet have both shown great results. If you&#8217;re able to configure the behaviour then low latency will help get the best performance</li>
<li><strong>Can I colocate MySQL Cluster data nodes with MySQL Servers in order use all posible resources?</strong> Yes, you can co-locate data nodes and MySQL Servers. Note that the management node (ndb_mgmd) should not run on the same machine as any of the data nodes &#8211; <a title="read this post for details on how to deploy MySQL Cluster nodes for High Availability" href="./../../mysql-cluster/mysql-cluster-fault-tolerance-impact-of-deployment-decisions/index.html" target="_blank">read this post for details on how to deploy MySQL Cluster nodes for High Availability</a></li>

<p>On 19th June 2014, Mats Kindahl and I presented a free webinar on why and how you should be using MySQL Fabric to add Sharding (scaling out reads &amp; writes) and High Availability to MySQL. The <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/mysql-fabric-high-availability-automated-sharding-for-mysql/" title="webinar replay - MySQL Fabric - High Availability &#038; Automated Sharding for MySQL" target="_blank">webinar replay is available here</a>. This blog post includes a transcript of the questions raised during the live webinar together with the responses given &#8211; if you&#8217;re questions aren&#8217;t answered already then please feel free to post them as comments here.</p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>MySQL Fabric is built around an extensible and open source framework for managing farms of MySQL Servers. Currently two features have been implemented &#8211; High Availability (built on top of MySQL Replication) and scaling out using data sharding. These features can be used in isolation or in combination. MySQL Fabric aware connectors allow transactions and queries to be routed to the correct servers without the need for a proxy node, so operations run as quickly as ever. In this webinar you will learn what MySQL Fabric is, what it can achieve and how it is used &#8211; by DBAs, Dev-Ops and developers. You&#8217;ll also be exposed to what is happening under the covers. In addition to the presentation, there will be live on-line Q&amp;A with the engineering team. This is a great opportunity to learn about the latest developments directly from the people building them.</p>
<h3>Q&#038;A</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is High availability still based on asynchronous replication?</strong>: MySQL Fabric will set up asynchronous replication; you can then manually switch to semisynchronous replication. MySQL Cluster is the only option to get synchronous replication.</li>
<li><strong>Is there any possibility of split brain (among slaves) when promoting a slave to be the new master?</strong>: For the current solution, based on MySQL Replication, there will at any point be at most a single write server. It can still be the case that one of the slaves are lagging (but if you enable semi-synchronous replication then the slave will be able to catch up as it has everything at least in its relay log), but no split brain situation.</li>
<li><strong>Are there hooks for different stages of the master pivot to update other orchestration/configuration systems?</strong>: You&#8217;re able to add script files to a directory and they will be invoked; it&#8217;s not currently very elegant but if it&#8217;s something you want to do then we can help you with it. We hope to make it more elegant/intuitive in the futures.</li>
<li><strong>Can we use the MySQL Fabric only for HA Solutions?</strong>: Yes &#8211; sharding is optional</li>
<li><strong>What happens if the slave is lagging and the primary goes down?</strong>: If using semisynchronous replication then the slave will apply it&#8217;s queued replication events before becoming master; if using asynchronous replication then those changes will not be there once the slave is promoted to master.</li>
<li><strong>For promoting slave, how does Fabric determine which slave to promote? How is it guaranteed to have all available binlog events applied?</strong>: Currently, MySQL Fabric picks the slave that has the most changes from the master and re-direct the other slaves to the promoted slave. The outstanding events in the relay log is processed as normal. Note that as a user, you can specify which slaves are candidates to be promoted to master and also which use semisynchronous rather than synchronous replication.</li>
<li><strong>What is the typical time to detect primary failure, choose slave candidate and complete the promotion of the new primary?</strong>: We haven&#8217;t run any benchmarks, but the ping frequency is configurable, so the detection time depends on how often you check the servers. Choosing a new primary and promoting it is straightforward. The deciding factor is the number of outstanding events on the promoted slave and the time to process them.</li>
<li><strong>For HA group, how do you prevent or mitigate false positives for failover of primary?</strong>: You can specify how many connector instances need to report the master as unavailable and how many times &#8211; in that way you can decide what constitues a failure vs. a transient or local issue.</li>
<li><strong>Are the HA Groups based on standard replication techniques? GTID&#8217;s?</strong>: The HA group is based on a set of MySQL Servers &#8211; one is a replication master and the rest are replication slaves; for HA, GTIDs are used.</li>
<li><strong>Do the HA groups rely on GTID&#8217;s setup in combination with mysqlrpladmin/mysqlfailover tools?</strong>: MySQL Fabric uses GTID&#8217;s to failover the slaves correctly, in a similar way to how <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-utilities/1.4/en/mysqlfailover.html" title="mysqlfailover" target="_blank">mysqlfailover</a> does, but has its own code for performing the failover.</li>
<li><strong>Can you explain &#8220;Zero Data Loss&#8221; in MySQL 5.7 when using MySQL Replication?</strong>: The enhancement is that with semisynchronous replication in 5.7, the commit will not be externalised until the event has been receive by a slave. This means that if any application sees the result of the transaction then you&#8217;re guaranteed that the effects of that transaction will not be lost even if the master fails.</li>
<li><strong>Is the Fabric Connector node a single point of failure or does it have failover as well?</strong>: Each application instance has an associated connector instance; if they fail then the other instances continue to provide service. Of course, if you have a single application process then you have a vulnerability &#8211; regardless of what the database provides.</li>
<li><strong>Does MySQL Fabric choose a primary for us (i.e. we do not get to choose which instance is primary)?</strong>: You get to specify which of the slaves are *candidates* for promotion (others can be there to just act as read-slaves) and so you have control.</li>
<li><strong>How many nodes are required to setup Sharding (Minimum number of servers)?</strong>: For sharding you need at least one server for each shard. If you want HA then each shard needs at least 2 servers (and the Fabric node should be on a different machine). i.e. minimum of 2 servers for sharding, minimum of 3 machines for HA, minimum of 4 servers/3 machines for HA *and* sharding</li>
<li><strong>Do the shards support typical SQL constructs such as joins and FKs across nodes?</strong>: Queries (including joins) are local to a shard. If you have global tables (all data replicated to all shards) then you can have joins between that data and the data held within a particular shard.</li>
<li><strong>If I would start with, 2 shards (so 2 HA groups). Can I expand this to 4 shards and let Fabric rebuild the shards based on the ranges?</strong>: Yes &#8211; there is a <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-utilities/1.4/en/fabric-util-sharding-commands.html" title="MySQL Fabric shard splitting command - mysql fabric sharding split_shard command" target="_blank">MySQL Fabric shard splitting command &#8211; mysql fabric sharding split_shard command</a> which splits a single shard into 2 shards (on 2 different HA groups)</li>
<li><strong>Does a shard split trigger write locks?</strong>: Writes can continue through most of the shard split *but* there is a period at the end where they will be locked &#8211; the longest time this can be is the tie of your longest transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Can we run global SELECT query againts multiple shards and get result from all shards?</strong>: Currently, a single query can only access global (unsharded) tables or a single shard; the application would need to send in multiple queries if it wanted to get results from multple shards.</li>
<li><strong>Can we have a query for both global data and one of the shard data combied together?</strong>: Absolutely &#8211; yes</li>
<li><strong>This appears to be using inline queries. What about stored procedures?</strong>: Any stored procedures would be executed locally on the MySQL Server selected by the connector (i.e. it would not be run accross multiple shards).</li>
<li><strong>Does MySQL Fabric support the Memcache API to InnoDB?</strong>: Theres&#8217;s no support for the Memcached API at this point. However, your app can access the Fabric mapping/state data and use that to route to the correct server.</li>
<li><strong>Are there plans to make the connector sharding logic automatic (i.e. application wouldn&#8217;t need to break out the sharding key) in the many cases where there is no ambiguity (returning with an error when the shard cannon be derived)? ie: A non-transactional select on a single table with shard key in WHERE could always go to a read-slave in the proper shard.</strong>: This is something we&#8217;d like to add but we can&#8217;t make any commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Do MySQL Fabric-aware connectors implement automatic failover?</strong>: Yes, the MySQL Fabric-aware connectors fail over by themselves after MySQL Fabric has promoted the new master.</li>
<li><strong>In the future will there be a transparant connector for other languages (most applications use default (and dumb) mysql connectors)</strong>: We plan to make other connectors MySQL Fabric-aware and for those that aren&#8217;t owned by Oracle, we&#8217;d love to advise the community owners how to adapt them.</li>
<li><strong>A lot of Open Source applications don&#8217;t care about the MySQL back-end, whether it is replicated or not. They use the standard MySQL connector that is supplied in their programming language. A transparant gateway-like connector would benefit here for migration.</strong>: We hope to get Fabric support into as many connectors as possible. Note that these aren&#8217;t &#8216;special&#8217; PHP, Java or Python connectors &#8211; we add Fabric support to the &#8220;standard connectors&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>are there any size limitations on the mysql databases that are being used?</strong>: There are no additional constraints imposed on the MySQL servers by MySQL Fabric.</li>
<li><strong>Are there any plan for a fabric GUI management interface?</strong>: It would be nice to have but we don&#8217;t have anything at present; the command-line-interface and XML/RPC APIs were the priority so that the functionality can be embedded within a user&#8217;s wider infrastructure (e.g. invoking the MySQL Fabric commands from an existing script).</li>
<li><strong>Do all machines need to have the same resources?</strong>: No, all of the MySQL Servers in a HA group (or the machines they&#8217;re running on) do not have to be equal. You can specify which servers are candidates to become the master and also specify weights so that more powerful servers receiver more queries.</li>
<li><strong>Do you need any specific MySQL setup for using MySQL Fabric?</strong>: MySQL Fabric operate using normal MySQL servers and rely on standard replication to handle high-availability and sharding.</li>
<li><strong>Are there any limitations wrt AWS RDS for MySQL Fabric?</strong>: The usual limitation mentioned when using AWS is when virtual IP support is required. MySQL Fabric *does not rely on virtual IP support* and handles the routing in the connectors.</li>
<li><strong>Do we need GTID for MySQL Fabric setup?</strong>: In the current GA version of MySQL Fabric, GTID&#8217;s have to be enabled on the servers being managed in order for the HA features to work.</li>
<li><strong>Do we need MySQL GTID for MySQL Fabric ?</strong>: For the HA aspects &#8211; yes.</li>
<li><strong>Any specific MySQL parameters required for MySQL Fabric?</strong>: You need to enable GTIDs and you need to have a binary log on the servers that are candidates for being master. You also need to enable UUID support, since MySQL Fabric distinguishes between the servers using their UUID.</li>
<li><strong>Can MySQL Fabric support removing nodes?</strong>: Yes, MySQL Fabric supports removing servers from HA Groups as well as adding new ones.</li>
<li><strong>It was mentioned that the Fabric controller is a single node. How do you avoid SPOF on the controller?</strong>: The connectors hold a cache of the mapping and state data and so they can continue to route requests when the Fabric node is unavailable. Of course we would like to add redundancy for the Fabric node but queries and transactions can continue while it is unavailable.</li>
<li><strong>Is there any Oracle RAC like (active-active) HA solution for MySQL?</strong>: MySQL offers <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/cluster/" title="MySQL Cluster" target="_blank">MySQL Cluster</a> as an active-active HA solution; unlike Oracle RAC though it does not depend on shared storage.</li>
<li><strong>Is it useful if I use mysql cluster 7.3 instead of replication mode? since cluster has HA functionality itself</strong>: At the moment, you cannot use MySQL Cluster with MySQL Fabric. MySQL Cluster does offer transparrent sharding and High Availability. MySQL Fabric is ideal when you want simple HA and sharding but you want to continue using InnoDB as your storage engine.</li>
<li><strong>Is MySQL Fabric stable for production deployment ?</strong>: It is Generally Available which means that we&#8217;ve completed our testing and are confident that it&#8217;s ready for live deployment but of course you should do your own testing to satisfy yourself that it&#8217;s working correctly *in your environment and with your application*</li>
<li><strong>Does fabric require a commercial license/subscription?</strong>: It&#8217;s available under the GPL2 Open Source license or if you want a commercial license/subscription then it&#8217;s also part of MySQL Enterprise Edition and MysQL Carrier Grade Edition</li>
<li><strong>How about Enterprise support for Fabric?</strong>: It&#8217;s in the community version of MySQL but also part of MySQL Enterprise Edition.</li>

<p>This post focuses on MySQL Fabric as a whole &#8211; both High Availability and scaling out (sharding). It starts with introductions to HA and scaling out (by partitioning/sharding data) and how MySQL Fabric achieves it before going on to work through a full example of deploying HA with MySQL Fabric and then adding sharding on top.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#what-mysql-fabric-provides" name="what-mysql-fabric-provides"></a>What MySQL Fabric Provides</h2>
<p>MySQL Fabric is built around an extensible framework for managing farms of MySQL Servers. Currently two features have been implemented &#8211; High Availability and scaling out using data sharding. Either of these features can be used in isolation or in combination.</p>
<p>Both features are implemented in two layers:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The <em>mysqlfabric</em> process which processes any management requests &#8211; whether received through the <em>mysqlfabric</em> command-line-interface (the manual for which can be found at <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-utilities/1.4/en/fabric.html">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-utilities/1.4/en/fabric.html</a>) or from another process via the supplied XML/RPC interface. When using the HA feature, this process can also be made responsible for monitoring the master server and initiating failover to promote a slave to be the new master should it fail. The state of the server farm is held in the state store (a MySQL database) and the <em>mysqlfabric</em> process is responsible for providing the state and routing information to the connectors.</li>
<li>MySQL Connectors are used by the application code to access the database(s), converting instructions from a specific programming language to the MySQL wire protocol, which is used to communicate with the MySQL Server processes. A &#8216;Fabric-aware&#8217; connector stores a cache of the routing information that it has received from the <em>mysqlfabric</em> process and then uses that information to send transactions or queries to the correct MySQL Server. Currently the three supported Fabric-aware MySQL connectors are for PHP, Python and Java (and in turn the Doctrine and Hibernate Object-Relational Mapping frameworks). This approach means that the latency and potential bottleneck of sending all requests via a proxy can be avoided.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#high-availability" name="high-availability"></a>High Availability</h3>
<p>High Availability (HA) refers to the ability for a system to provide continuous service &#8211; a system is available while that service can be utilized. The level of availability is often expressed in terms of the &#8220;number of nines&#8221; &#8211; for example, a HA level of 99.999% means that the service can be used for 99.999% of the time, in other words, on average, the service is only unavailable for 5.25 minutes per year (and that includes all scheduled as well as unscheduled down-time).</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" href="#different-points-of-high-availability" name="different-points-of-high-availability"></a>Different Points of High Availability</h4>
<p><a href="./../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-18-at-13.53.05.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3815" src="./../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-18-at-13.53.05-300x217.png" alt="Layers in architecture where High Availability is needed" width="300" height="217" srcset="./../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-18-at-13.53.05-300x217.png 300w, ./../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-18-at-13.53.05.png 734w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The figure shows the different layers in the system that need to be available for service to be provided.</p>
<p>At the bottom is the data that the service relies on. Obviously, if that data is lost then the service cannot function correctly and so it&#8217;s important to make sure that there is at least one extra copy of that data. This data can be duplicated at the storage layer itself but with MySQL, it&#8217;s most commonly replicated by the layer above &#8211; the MySQL Server using MySQL Replication. The MySQL Server provides access to the data &#8211; there is no point in the data being there if you can&#8217;t get at it! It&#8217;s a common misconception that having redundancy at these two levels is enough to have a HA system but you also need to look at the system from the top-down.</p>
<p>To have a HA service, there needs to be redundancy at the application layer; in itself this is very straight-forward, just load balance all of the service requests over a pool of application servers which are all running the same application logic. If the service were something as simple as a random number generator then this would be fine but most useful applications need to access data and as soon as you move beyond a single database server (for example because it needs to be HA) then a way is needed to connect the application server to the correct data source. In a HA system, the routing isn&#8217;t a static function, if one database server should fail (or be taken down for maintenance) the application should be directed instead to an alternate database. Some HA systems implement this routing function by introducing a proxy process between the application and the database servers; others use a virtual IP address which can be migrated to the correct server. When using MySQL Fabric, this routing function is implemented within the Fabric-aware MySQL connector library that&#8217;s used by the application server processes.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" href="#what-mysql-fabric-adds-in-terms-of-high-availability" name="what-mysql-fabric-adds-in-terms-of-high-availability"></a>What MySQL Fabric Adds in Terms of High Availability</h4>
<p>MySQL Fabric has the concept of a HA group which is a pool of two or more MySQL Servers; at any point in time, one of those servers is the Primary (MySQL Replication master) and the others are Secondaries (MySQL Replication slaves). The role of a HA group is to ensure that access to the data held within that group is always available.</p>
<p>While MySQL Replication allows the data to be made safe by duplicating it, for a HA solution two extra components are needed and MySQL Fabric provides these:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Failure detection and promotion</strong> &#8211; the MySQL Fabric process monitors the Primary within the HA group and should that server fail then it selects one of the Secondaries and promotes it to be the Primary (with all of the other slaves in the HA group then receiving updates from the new master). Note that the connectors can inform MySQL Fabric when they observe a problem with the Primary and the MySQL Fabric process uses that information as part of its decision making process surrounding the state of the servers in the farm.</li>
<li><strong>Routing of database requests</strong> &#8211; When MySQL Fabric promotes the new Primary, it updates the state store and notifies the connectors so that they can refresh their caches with the updated routing information. In this way, the application does not need to be aware that the topology has changed and that writes need to be sent to a different destination.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#scaling-out---sharding" name="scaling-out---sharding"></a>Scaling Out &#8211; Sharding</h3>
<p>When nearing the capacity or write performance limit of a single MySQL Server (or <a title="MySQL Fabric â€“ adding High Availability to MySQL" href="./../../mysql-fabric/mysql-fabric-adding-high-availability-to-mysql/index.html">HA group</a>), MySQL Fabric can be used to scale-out the database servers by partitioning the data across multiple MySQL Server &#8220;groups&#8221;. Note that a group could contain a single MySQL Server or it could be a HA group.</p>
<p><a href="./../../wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-17-at-08.04.21.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3915 size-medium" src="./../../wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-17-at-08.04.21-300x250.png" alt="MySQL Fabric Architecture" width="300" height="250" srcset="./../../wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-17-at-08.04.21-300x250.png 300w, ./../../wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-17-at-08.04.21.png 819w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The administrator defines how data should be partitioned/sharded between these servers; this is done by creating shard mappings. A shard mapping applies to a set of tables and for each table the administrator specifies which column from those tables should be used as a shard key (the shard key will subsequently be used by MySQL Fabric to calculate which shard a specific row from one of those tables should be part of). Because all of these tables use the same shard key and mapping, the use of the same column value in those tables will result in those rows being in the same shard &#8211; allowing a single transaction to access all of them. For example, if using the subscriber-id column from multiple tables then all of the data for a specific subscriber will be in the same shard. The administrator then defines how that shard key should be used to calculate the shard number:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>HASH</strong>: A hash function is run on the shard key to generate the shard number. If values held in the column used as the sharding key don&#8217;t tend to have too many repeated values then this should result in an even partitioning of rows across the shards.</li>
<li><strong>RANGE</strong>: The administrator defines an explicit mapping between ranges of values for the sharding key and shards. This gives maximum control to the user of how data is partitioned and which rows should be co-located.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>When the application needs to access the sharded database, it sets a property for the connection that specifies the sharding key &#8211; the Fabric-aware connector will then apply the correct range or hash mapping and route the transaction to the correct shard.</p>
<p>If further shards/groups are needed then MySQL Fabric can split an existing shard into two and then update the state-store and the caches of routing data held by the connectors. Similarly, a shard can be moved from one HA group to another.</p>
<p>Note that a single transaction or query can only access a single shard and so it is important to select shard keys based on an understanding of the data and the application&#8217;s access patterns. It doesn&#8217;t always make sense to shard all tables as some may be relatively small and having their full contents available in each group can be beneficial given the rule about no cross-shard queries. These global tables are written to a &#8216;global group&#8217; and any additions or changes to data in those tables are automatically replicated to all of the other groups. Schema changes are also made to the global group and replicated to all of the others to ensure consistency.</p>
<p>To get the best mapping, it may also be necessary to modify the schema if there isn&#8217;t already a &#8216;natural choice&#8217; for the sharding keys.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#worked-example" name="worked-example"></a>Worked Example</h2>
<p>The example that this post steps through starts by setting up MySQL Fabric itself and then uses it to manage HA using a group of MySQL Servers. An example application will store data in this new configuration. After that, the example will introduce shards to the server farm in order to scale out capacity and read/write performance.</p>
<p>The following sections set up the sharded MySQL configuration shown here before running some (Python) code against &#8211; with queries and transactions routed to the correct MySQL Server.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#building-the-mysql-fabric-framework" name="building-the-mysql-fabric-framework"></a>Building the MySQL Fabric Framework</h3>
<p>Note that this section is repeated from the earlier two posts and so can be skipped if you&#8217;ve already worked through one of them.</p>
<p>The machines being used already have MySQL 5.6 installed (though in a custom location) and so the only software pre-requisite is to install the MySQL connector for Python from the <a title="MySQL Connector/Python download page" href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/">connector download page</a> and MySQL Fabric (part of MySQL Utilities) from the <a title="MySQL Fabric download page" href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/fabric/">MySQL Fabric download page</a>:</p>
<pre>[root@fab1 mysql ~]# rpm -i mysql-connector-python-1.2.2-1.el6.noarch.rpm
[root@fab1 mysql ~]# rpm -i mysql-utilities-1.4.3-1.el6.noarch.rpm
</pre>
<p>MySQL Fabric needs access to a MySQL Database to store state and routing information for the farm of servers; if there isn&#8217;t already a running MySQL Server instance that can be used for this then it&#8217;s simple to set one up:</p>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 ~]$ mkdir myfab
[mysql@fab1 ~]$ cd myfab/
[mysql@fab1 myfab]$ mkdir data  
[mysql@fab1 myfab]$ cat my.cnf

[mysql@fab1 ~]$ mysqld --defaults-file=/home/mysql/myfab/my.cnf &amp;
</pre>
<p>MySQL Fabric needs to be able to access this state store and so a dedicated user is created (note that the <code>fabric</code> database hasn&#8217;t yet been created &#8211; that will be done soon using the <code>mysqlfabric</code> command):</p>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 ~]$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P3306 -u root -e "GRANT ALL ON fabric.* \
    TO fabric@localhost";
</pre>
<p>All of the management requests that we make for MySQL Fabric will be issued via the <code>mysqlfabric</code> command. This command is documented in the <a title="MySQL Fabric - documentation for the mysqlfabric command" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-utilities/1.4/en/fabric-util.html">MySQL Fabric User Guide</a> but sub-commands can be viewed from the terminal using the <code>list-commands</code> option:</p>

<p>MySQL Fabric has its own configuration file (note that its location can vary depending on your platform and how MySQL Utilities were installed). The contents of this configuration file should be reviewed before starting the MySQL Fabric process (in this case, the <code>mysqldump_program</code> and <code>mysqlclient_program</code> settings needed to be changed as MySQL was installed in a user&#8217;s directory) and the MySQL Fabric management port was changed to <code>8080</code> and authentication for the management interface was disabled:</p>

<p>The final step before starting the MySQL Fabric process is to create the MySQL Fabric schema within the state store:</p>
<pre>[root@fab1 mysql]# mysqlfabric manage setup --param=storage.user=fabric

</pre>
<p>An optional step is then to check for yourself that the schema is indeed there:</p>

<p>At this point, the MySQL Fabric process (and its associate state store) is up and running, as are the MySQL Servers that will become part of the HA group.

<p>At this stage, the MySQL replication relationship is configured and running but there isn&#8217;t yet High Availability as MySQL Fabric is not monitoring the state of the servers &#8211; the final configuration step fixes that:</p>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 ~]$ mysqlfabric group activate group_id-1
Procedure :
{ uuid        = 40a5e023-06ba-4e1e-93de-4d4195f87851,
  finished    = True,
  success     = True,
  return      = True,
  activities  =
}
</pre>
<p>Everything is now set up to detect if the Primary (master) should fail and in the event that it does, promote one of the Secondaries to be the new Primary. If using one of the MySQL Fabric-aware connectors (initially PHP, Python and Java) then that failover can be transparent to the application.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#run-an-application-against-the-ha-farm" name="run-an-application-against-the-ha-farm"></a>Run an Application Against the HA Farm</h3>
<p>The code that follows shows how an application can accesses the new HA group &#8211; in this case, using the Python connector. First an application table is created:</p>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 myfab]$ cat setup_table_ha.py
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import fabric

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    fabric={"host" : "localhost", "port" : 32274, "username": "admin", \
    	"password" : "admin"},
    user="root", database="test", password="",
    autocommit=True
)

conn.set_property(mode=fabric.MODE_READWRITE, group="group_id-1")
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute(
"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS subscribers ("
"   sub_no INT, "
"   first_name CHAR(40), "
"   last_name CHAR(40)"
")"
) 
</pre>
<p>Note the following about that code sample:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The connector is provided with the address for the MySQL Fabric process <code>localhost:32274</code> rather than any of the MySQL Servers</li>
<li>The <code>mode</code> property for the connection is set to <code>fabric.MODE_READWRITE</code> which the connector will interpret as meaning that the transaction should be sent to the Primary (as that&#8217;s where all writes must be executed so that they can be replicated to the Secondaries)</li>
<li>The <code>group</code> property is set to <code>group_id-1</code> which is the name that was given to the single HA Group</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>This code can now be executed and then a check made on one of the Secondaries that the table creation has indeed been replicated from the Primary.</p>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 myfab]$ python setup_table_ha.py
[mysql@fab1 myfab]$ mysql -h 192.168.56.103 -P3306 -u root \
    -e "use test;show tables"
+----------------+
| Tables_in_test |
+----------------+
| subscribers    |
+----------------+
</pre>
<p>The next step is to add some rows to the table:</p>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 myfab]$ cat add_subs_ha.py
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import fabric

def add_subscriber(conn, sub_no, first_name, last_name):
    conn.set_property(group="group_id-1", mode=fabric.MODE_READWRITE)
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute(
        "REPLACE INTO subscribers VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",
        (sub_no, first_name, last_name)
        )

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    fabric={"host" : "localhost", "port" : 32274, "username": "admin", \
    	"password" : "admin"},
    user="root", database="test", password="",
    autocommit=True
    )

conn.set_property(group="group_id-1", mode=fabric.MODE_READWRITE)

add_subscriber(conn, 72, "Billy", "Fish")
add_subscriber(conn, 500, "Billy", "Joel")
add_subscriber(conn, 1500, "Arthur", "Askey")
add_subscriber(conn, 5000, "Billy", "Fish")
add_subscriber(conn, 15000, "Jimmy", "White")
add_subscriber(conn, 17542, "Bobby", "Ball")
</pre>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 myfab]$ python add_subs_ha.py
</pre>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 myfab]$ mysql -h 192.168.56.103 -P3306 -u root \
    -e "select * from test.subscribers"
+--------+------------+-----------+
| sub_no | first_name | last_name |
+--------+------------+-----------+
|     72 | Billy      | Fish      |
|    500 | Billy      | Joel      |
|   1500 | Arthur     | Askey     |
|   5000 | Billy      | Fish      |
|  15000 | Jimmy      | White     |
|  17542 | Bobby      | Ball      |
+--------+------------+-----------+
</pre>
<p>And then the data can be retrieved (note that the <code>mode</code> parameter for the connection is set to <code>fabric.MODE_READONLY</code> and so the connector knows that it can load balance the requests across any MySQL Servers in the HA Group).</p>
<pre>mysql@fab1 myfab]$ cat read_table_ha.py
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import fabric

def find_subscriber(conn, sub_no):
    conn.set_property(group="group_id-1", mode=fabric.MODE_READONLY)
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute(
        "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM subscribers "
        "WHERE sub_no = %s", (sub_no, )
        )
    for row in cur:
        print row

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    fabric={"host" : "localhost", "port" : 32274, "username": "admin", \
    	"password" : "admin"},
    user="root", database="test", password="",
    autocommit=True
    )

find_subscriber(conn, 72)
find_subscriber(conn, 500)
find_subscriber(conn, 1500)
find_subscriber(conn, 5000)
find_subscriber(conn, 15000)
find_subscriber(conn, 17542)

</pre>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 myfab]$ python read_table_ha.py
(u'Billy', u'Fish')
(u'Billy', u'Joel')
(u'Arthur', u'Askey')
(u'Billy', u'Fish')
(u'Jimmy', u'White')
(u'Bobby', u'Ball')
</pre>
<p>Note that if the Secondary servers don&#8217;t all have the same performance then you can skew the ratio for how many reads are sent to each one using the <code>mysqlfabric server set_weight</code> command &#8211; specifying a value between 0 and 1 (default is 1 for all servers). Additionally, the <code>mysqlfabric server set_mode</code> command can be used to specify if the Primary should receive some of the reads (<code>READ_WRITE</code>) or only writes (<code>WRITE_ONLY</code>).</p>
<p>The next section describes how this configuration can be extended to add scalability by sharding the table data (and it can be skipped if that isn&#8217;t needed).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#adding-scale-out-with-sharding" name="adding-scale-out-with-sharding"></a>Adding Scale-Out with Sharding</h3>
<p>The example in this section builds upon the previous one by adding more servers in order to scale out the capacity and read/write performance of the database. The first step is to create a new group (which is named <code>global-group</code> in this example) &#8211; the Global Group is a special HA group that performs two critical functions:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Any data schema changes are applied to the Global Group and from there they will be replicated to each of the other HA Groups</li>
<li>If there are tables that contain data that should be replicated to all HA groups (rather than sharded) then any inserts, updates or deletes will be made on the Global Group and then replicated to the others. Those tables are referred to as global tables.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

  activities  =
}
</pre>
<p>As an application table has already been created within the original HA group, that will need to copied to the new Global Group:</p>
<pre>mysql@fab1 myfab]$ mysqldump -d -u root --single-transaction \
    -h 192.168.56.102 -P3306 --all-databases &gt; my-schema.sql

    -e 'reset master'
[mysql@fab1 myfab]$ mysql -h 192.168.56.102 -P3317 -u root \
	&lt; my-schema.sql
[mysql@fab1 ~]$ mysql -h 192.168.56.102 -P3317 -u root -e \
	'show create table test.subscribers\G'
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: subscribers
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `subscribers` (
  `sub_no` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `first_name` char(40) DEFAULT NULL,
  `last_name` char(40) DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
</pre>
<p>A shard mapping is an entity that is used to define how certain tables should be sharded between a set of HA groups. It is possible to have multiple shard mappings but in this example, only one will be used. When defining the shard mapping, there are two key parameters:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The type of mapping &#8211; can be either <code>HASH</code> or <code>RANGE</code></li>
<li>The global group that will be used</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The commands that follow define the mapping and identify the index number assigned to this mapping (in this example &#8211; <code>3</code>) &#8211; in fact that same index is recovered in two different ways: using the <code>mysqlfabric</code> command and then reading the data directly from the state store:</p>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 ~]$ mysqlfabric sharding create_definition HASH global-group
Procedure :
{ uuid        = 78ea7209-b073-4d03-9d8b-bda92cc76f32,
  finished    = True,
  success     = True,
  return      = 1,
  activities  =
}

[mysql@fab1 ~]$ mysqlfabric sharding list_definitions
Command :
{ success     = True
  return      = [[1, 'HASH', 'global-group']]
  activities  =
}

[mysql@fab1 ~]$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P3306 -u root \
	-e 'SELECT * FROM fabric.shard_maps'
+------------------+-----------+--------------+
| shard_mapping_id | type_name | global_group |
+------------------+-----------+--------------+
|                1 | HASH      | global-group |
+------------------+-----------+--------------+
</pre>
<p>The next step is to define what columns from which tables should be used as the sharding key (the value on which the HASH function is executed or is compared with the defined RANGEs). In this example, only one table is being sharded (the <code>subscribers</code> table with the <code>sub_no</code> column being used as the sharding key) but the command can simply be re-executed for further tables. Note that the identifier for the shard mapping (1) is passed on the command-line:</p>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 ~]$ mysqlfabric sharding add_table 1 test.subscribers sub_no
Procedure :
{ uuid        = 446aadd1-ffa6-4d19-8d52-4683f3d7c998,
  finished    = True,
  success     = True,
  return      = True,
  activities  =
}
</pre>
<p>At this point, the shard mapping has been defined but no shards have been created and so the next step is to create a single shard and that shard will be stored in the existing HA group (<code>group_id-1</code>):</p>
<pre>[mysql@fab1 ~]$ mysqlfabric sharding add_shard 1 group_id-1 --state=enabled
Procedure :
{ uuid        = 4efc038c-cd18-448d-be32-ca797c4c006f,
  finished    = True,
  success     = True,
  return      = True,
  activities  =
}

[mysql@fab1]$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P3306 -u root \
    -e 'select * from fabric.shards'
+----------+------------+---------+
| shard_id | group_id   | state   |
+----------+------------+---------+
|        1 | group_id-1 | ENABLED |
+----------+------------+---------+
</pre>
<p>At this point, the database has technically been sharded but of course it offers no scalability as there is only a single shard. The steps that follow evolve that configuration into one containing two shards as shown in the following figure.</p>

<p>At this point, the new HA group exists but is missing the application schema and data. Before allocating a shard to the group, a <code>reset master</code> needs to be executed on the Primary for the group (this is required because changes have already been made on that server &#8211; if nothing else, to grant permissions for one or more users to connect remotely).

<h3><a class="anchor" href="#splitting-the-shard" name="splitting-the-shard"></a>Splitting the Shard</h3>
<p>The next step is to split the existing shard, specifying the shard id (in this case <code>1</code>) and the name of the HA group where the new shard will be stored:</p>
<pre>[mysql@fab1]$ mysqlfabric sharding split_shard 1 group_id-2

<p>Before looking at the application code changes that are needed to cope with the sharded data, a simple test can be run to confirm that the table&#8217;s existing data has indeed been split between the two shards:</p>
<pre>[mysql@fab1]$ mysql -h 192.168.56.102 -P3306 -uroot \

<p>The next example Python code adds some new rows to the <code>subscribers</code> table. Note that the <code>tables</code> property for the connection is set to <code>test.subscribers</code> and the <code>key</code> to the value of the <code>sub_no</code> column for that table &#8211; this is enough information for the Fabric-aware connector to choose the correct shard/HA group and then the fact that the <code>mode</code> property is set to <code>fabric.MODE_READWRITE</code> further tells the connector that the transaction should be sent to the Primary within that HA group.</p>

<p>The final example application code reads the row for each of the records that have been added, the key thing to note here is that the <code>mode</code> property for the connection has been set to <code>fabric.MODE_READONLY</code> so that the Fabric-aware Python connector knows that it can load balance requests over the Secondaries within the HA groups rather than sending everything to the Primary.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#current-limitations" name="current-limitations"></a>Current Limitations</h2>
<p>The initial version of MySQL Fabric is designed to be simple, robust and able to scale to thousands of MySQL Servers. This approach means that this version has a number of limitations, which are described here:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Sharding is not completely transparent to the application. While the application need not be aware of which server stores a set of rows and it doesn&#8217;t need to be concerned when that data is moved, it does need to provide the sharding key when accessing the database.</li>
<li>All transactions and queries need to be limited in scope to the rows held in a single shard, together with the global (non-sharded) tables. For example, Joins involving multiple shards are not supported.</li>
<li>Because the connectors perform the routing function, the extra latency involved in proxy-based solutions is avoided but it does mean that Fabric-aware connectors are required &#8211; at the time of writing these exist for PHP, Python and Java</li>
<li>The MySQL Fabric process itself is not fault-tolerant and must be restarted in the event of it failing. Note that this does not represent a single-point-of-failure for the server farm (HA and/or sharding) as the connectors are able to continue routing operations using their local caches while the MySQL Fabric process is unavailable.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#mysql-fabric-architecture--extensibility" name="mysql-fabric-architecture--extensibility"></a>MySQL Fabric Architecture &amp; Extensibility</h2>
<p>MySQL Fabric has been architected for extensibility at a number of levels. For example, in the first release the only option for implementing HA is based on MySQL Replication but in future releases we hope to add further options (for example, MySQL Cluster). We also hope to see completely new applications around the managing of farms of MySQL Servers &#8211; both from Oracle and the wider MySQL community.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates how new applications and protocols can be added using the pluggable framework.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#next-steps" name="next-steps"></a>Next Steps</h2>
<p>We really hope that people try out MySQL Fabric and let us know how you get on; one way is to comment on this post, another is to post to the <a title="MySQL Forums :: Fabric, Sharding, HA, Utilities" href="http://forums.mysql.com/list.php?144">MySQL Fabric forum</a> or if you think you&#8217;ve found a bug then <a title="MySQL bugs database" href="http://bugs.mysql.com/">raise a bug report</a>.</p>
