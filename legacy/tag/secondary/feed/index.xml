<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of excitement about NoSQL data stores, with the promise of simple access patterns, flexible schemas, scalability, and high availability. The downside comes in the form of losing ACID transactions, consistency, flexible queries, and data integrity checks. What if you could have the best of both worlds? Join this webinar to learn how MySQL Cluster provides simultaneous SQL and native NoSQL access to your data—whether it’s in a simple key-value API (memcached) or REST, JavaScript, Java, or C++. You will hear how the MySQL Cluster architecture delivers in-memory real-time performance; 99.999 percent availability; online maintenance; and linear, horizontal scalability through transparent autosharding.</p>

The binary and source versions of MySQL Cluster 7.4.5 have now been made available at <a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/</a>.</p>
<h2>Release notes</h2>
<p>MySQL Cluster NDB 7.4.5 is a new maintenance release of MySQL Cluster, based on MySQL Server 5.6 and including features from version 7.4 of the NDB storage engine, as well as fixing a number of recently discovered bugs in previous MySQL Cluster releases. </p>
<p>This release also incorporates all bugfixes and changes made in previous MySQL Cluster releases, as well as all bugfixes and feature changes which were added in mainline <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-23.html" title="MySQL 5.6.23 Release Notes" target="_blank">MySQL 5.6 through MySQL 5.6.23</a>.</p>
<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
        It was found during testing that problems could arise when the<br />
        node registered as the arbitrator disconnected or failed during<br />
        the arbitration process.
      </p>
<p>
        In this situation, the node requesting arbitration could never<br />
        receive a positive acknowledgement from the registered<br />
        arbitrator; this node also lacked a stable set of members and<br />
        could not initiate selection of a new arbitrator.
      </p>
<p>
        Now in such cases, when the arbitrator fails or loses contact<br />
        during arbitration, the requesting node immediately fails rather<br />
        than waiting to time out.<br />
       (Bug #20538179)</p>

        A scan operation, whether it is a single table scan or a query<br />

        This maximum size of this buffer is calculated and preallocated<br />
        before the scan operation is started. This buffer may consume a<br />
        considerable amount of memory; in some cases we observed a 2 GB<br />
        buffer footprint in tests that executed 100 parallel scans with<br />
        2 single-threaded (<span class="command"><strong>ndbd</strong></span>) data nodes. This<br />

</ul>
</div>
<p>
        These issues became more evident in NDB 7.2 and later MySQL<br />
        Cluster release series. This was due to the fact buffer size is<br />
        scaled by <a class="ulink" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-api-definition.html#ndbparam-api-batchsize" target="_top"><code class="literal">BatchSize</code></a>, and<br />
        that the default value for this parameter was increased fourfold<br />
        (from 64 to 256) beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 7.2.1.
      </p>
<p>
        This fix causes result rows to be buffered using the packed<br />
        format instead of the unpacked format; a buffered scan result<br />
        row is now not unpacked until it becomes the current row. In<br />
        addition, <code class="literal">BatchByteSize</code> and<br />
        <code class="literal">MaxScanBatchSize</code> are now used as limiting<br />
        factors when calculating the required buffer size.
      </p>
<p>
        Also as part of this fix, refactoring has been done to separate<br />
        handling of buffered (packed) from handling of unbuffered result<br />
        sets, and to remove code that had been unused since NDB 7.0 or<br />
        earlier. The <code class="literal">NdbRecord</code> class declaration has<br />
        also been cleaned up by removing a number of unused or redundant<br />
        member variables.<br />
       (Bug #73781, Bug #75599, Bug #19631350, Bug #20408733)</p>

<p><span style="color: #333399;">How important is your data? Can you afford to lose it? What about just some of it? What would be the impact if you couldn&#8217;t access it for a minute, an hour, a day or a week?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">Different applications can have very different requirements for High Availability. Some need 100% data reliability with 24x7x365 read &amp; write access while many others are better served by a simpler approach with more modest HA ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">MySQL has an array of High Availability solutions ranging from simple backups, through replication and shared storage clustering &#8211; all the way up to 99.999% available shared nothing, geographically replicated clusters. These solutions also have different &#8216;bonus&#8217; features such as full InnoDB compatibility, in-memory real-time performance, linear scalability and SQL &amp; NoSQL APIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;">The purpose of this webinar is to help you decide where your application sits in terms of HA requirements and discover which of the MySQL solutions best fit the bill. It will also cover what you need outside of the database to ensure High Availability &#8211; state of the art monitoring being a prime example.</span></p>

<h3>Functionality Added or Changed</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Recent improvements made to the multithreaded scheduler were intended to optimize the cache behavior of its internal data structures, with members of these structures placed such that those local to a given thread do not overflow into a cache line which can be accessed by another thread. Where required, extra padding bytes are inserted to isolate cache lines owned (or shared) by other threads, thus avoiding invalidation of the entire cache line if another thread writes into a cache line not entirely owned by itself. This optimization improved MT Scheduler performance by several percent.It has since been found that the optimization just described depends on the global instance of struct thr_repository starting at a cache line aligned base address as well as the compiler not rearranging or adding extra padding to the scheduler struct; it was also found that these prerequisites were not guaranteed (or even checked). Thus this cache line optimization has previously worked only when g_thr_repository (that is, the global instance) ended up being cache line aligned only by accident. In addition, on 64-bit platforms, the compiler added extra padding words in struct thr_safe_pool such that attempts to pad it to a cache line aligned size failed.
<p>The current fix ensures that g_thr_repository is constructed on a cache line aligned address, and the constructors modified so as to verify cacheline aligned adresses where these are assumed by design.</p>
<p>Results from internal testing show improvements in MT Scheduler read performance of up to 10% in some cases, following these changes. (Bug #18352514)</li>
<li><strong>Cluster API</strong>: Two new example programs, demonstrating reads and writes of CHAR, VARCHAR, and VARBINARY column values, have been added to storage/ndb/ndbapi-examples in the MySQL Cluster source tree. For more information about these programs, including source code listings, see <a title="NDB API Simple Array Example" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndbapi-examples-array-simple.html" target="_blank">NDB API Simple Array Example</a>, and <a title="NDB API Simple Array Example Using Adapter" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndbapi-examples-array-adapter.html" target="_blank">NDB API Simple Array Example Using Adapter</a>.</li>
