Hi Sam,

 unfortunately the enhanced conflict detection wouldn&#039;t work in that scenario - it only supports active-active pairs at present.

					<description><![CDATA[Andrew,

I was thinking of a ring inter cluster setup where there are say 5 clusters, however a single mysql instance in a cluster only replicates to one more.

Sam,

 unfortunately, the enhanced conflict resolution only works between pairs of Clusters.

Song Yi,

It&#039;s recorded in as part of a replication event inside the binary log (which isn&#039;t shown in the diagram).

					<description><![CDATA[In the Detecting conflicts GIF animation, the last diagram, secondary cluster send clock(100) to primary.

How can secondary remember the clock(100) which was sent from primary in early diagrams?
I don&#039;t see you add a column on secondary to store the clock(100).]]></description>

 this is covered in the &quot;What&#039;s new in MySQL Cluster 7.2&quot; white paper from http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/white-papers/mysql-cluster-7-2-new-features-whitepaper/

					<description><![CDATA[To expand on the answers :

2) It&#039;s important that the Secondary Cluster logs updates as updates, not as writes.  This can be configured using server options or the ndb_replication table.  If updates are logged as writes then they will not be handled correctly at the primary.

3) It *is* necessary to have --ndb-log-apply-status set on the Secondary Cluster, so that the ndb_apply_status entries from the Primary are returned back and it can determine when a Secondary sourced update is *not* in conflict.  It is not necessary to have it set on at the Primary Cluster.

Hope this clarifies things,

Kolbe,

 thanks for the feedback.

 1) You&#039;re right - fixed now.
 2) You shouldn&#039;t need to put anything into mysql.ndb_replication on the secondary Cluster (blue)
 3) You shouldn&#039;t need to set this. If yoiu still see this behaviour then let me know and I&#039;ll retest.

Regards, Andrew.]]></description>
