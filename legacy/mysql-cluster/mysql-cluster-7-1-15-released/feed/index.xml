Hi Ram,

 note that as you have set noofreplicas to 2, every row in a cluster table will be stored twice (once on each of 2 data nodes) and so your 4 Gbyte table will actually require 8 GBytes - if you have 2 servers than that means 4 GBytes on each. If you need to store that table on those servers (and can&#039;t add more memory) then consider storing at least some of the columns on disk rather than in memory... &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mysql-cluster-disk-data.html&lt;/a&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[I have two systems, 2GB RAM, i configured ndbd defualt with following values.
[ndbd default]
noofreplicas=2
DataMemory= 1024M
IndexMemory= 256M

I put the same in both the machines. I&#039;m trying to load 4GB data table, around 13million records. but it got inserted 10Lack records after that getting error as table is full. then i increased memory 1024 to 1280 and restarted mysqlcluster in both the systems.

[ndbd default]
noofreplicas=2
DataMemory= 1280M
IndexMemory= 256M

after it got inserted some more, now it has 1.3Million again started table is full. What is the calculation i need to follow as per my RAM. Is that data memory value is multiple of some value like 265,512,1024 etc. Is this RAM memory or harddisk memory?

if you dont mind i want to do live chat with you. if possible add my gmail a.c and ping me ramprasadmca@gmail.com]]></description>

Hi Ram,

 you don&#039;t mention what errors your seeing but it could well be that you haven&#039;t configured enough memory for your data nodes. MySQL Cluster doesn&#039;t allocate memory dynamically - when the data nodes start up the total amount of memory is allocated and then you eat into that as rows are added. You configure the amount of memory allocated by setting the DataMemory and IndexMemory parameters in the [ndbd default] section of your config.ini file.

The table data is automatically horizontally partitioned across all of the data nodes. You don&#039;t get to choose that you want a particular table to be stored on a particular data node.

The MySQL Server chooses a data node to send the query to and that data node will co-ordinate with the other data nodes if necessary to provide the response back to the MySQL Server. You can send a query (read or write) to any MySQL Server as they all have access to all data nodes.

You can perform complex queries including cross-table joins.

					<description><![CDATA[I have small query. In mysql cluster can we do the following scenarios?
Let us assume we have 4 data nodes. Each data node has different tables. 
1)If I query one table, if it is available in all the data nodes with different data. Will it fetch union of all and gives us the result?
2)Can i query multiple columns from multiple tables from multiple nodes?]]></description>
