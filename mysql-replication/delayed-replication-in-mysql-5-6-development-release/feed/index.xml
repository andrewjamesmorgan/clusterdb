In general, we don&#039;t retrofit new features to GA releases (users don&#039;t want to have to retest their applications when there are new maintenance releases) and there are no plans to back-port delayed replication,

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Andrew.

First of all I apologise for making questions in you won blog. But I&#039;m really stuck here with a problem which I think you can help me!

I&#039;ve installed mysql cluster and it&#039;s all running smoothly (1 manage server and 2 data nodes).

I&#039;m trying to intall mysql-php in the data nodes so that I can user phpmyadmin but when I run yum install php-mysql.x86_64 I got the conflict error: MySQL-Cluster-gpl-server conflicts with mysql. 

Are the not compatible? Because I reallu need the two of them.

Thanks.

Regards,
Vilhena]]></description>
