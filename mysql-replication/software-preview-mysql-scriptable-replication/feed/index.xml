					<description><![CDATA[Hi, 

This is an interesting feature.  We have put a lot of effort into SQL filtering in Tungsten (http://www.continuent.com/community), which I invite interested readers to try.  

Does scriptable replication allow you to change events?  For many problems, that&#039;s an important capability.  Also, how does Lua deal with binary or embedded charsets using introducers like _binary?  That&#039;s a pretty nasty feature if you are parsing statements.  Tungsten deals with this now but it was not easy.  (I finished the implementation a few weeks ago and it is posting this week as part of version 1.2.1.) 

Cheers, Robert]]></description>

Hi Henrik,

 this is a very preliminary version - the final implementation would work with RBR and Cluster as well.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Andrew

Cool feature, I can see this becoming popular. At Monty Program we have been planning some work that would make RBR replication more human readable and thus more easily filtered too.

Anyway, since this is purely STMT based replication for now, it seems it is not applicable to MySQL Cluster. In fact, surprising to see you cover this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for testing it and writing about it.

We think that the Scriptable Replication (also with plugins written in C/C++) will be the way to implement many replication features in the future, so it is great that we get feedback on it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You can probably optimize the matching pattern to create the shorter function:

  function after_read(event)
    local m = event.query
    if m then
      id = string.match(m, &quot;sub_id *= *(%d+)&quot;)
      if id then
        if id %2 == 1 then
          return true
        else
          return false
        end
      else
         return false
      end
    else
      return false
