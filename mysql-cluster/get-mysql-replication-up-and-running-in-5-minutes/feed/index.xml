Thanks for your question but I&#039;m afraid that I no longer work for Oracle (I&#039;m now working for MongoDB) and so am not current on MySQL technology. I&#039;d suggest checking the &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.mysql.com/list.php?25&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MySQL Cluster forum&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

You can use &lt;code&gt;stop slave&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;start slave&lt;/code&gt; on the slave to suspend replication. Provided you&#039;ve configured your binary log to be big enough, it will queue up all of the writes while replication is suspended.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Andrew,

I have a query in Mysql Replication on Windows box. Cant we create replication which transfers the all events(The objectives which are to be replicated) to slave in a time intervals instead of continuous flow of all the objects to salve? I meant to say is , i don&#039;t want to send the modifications continuously to the Slave from master , wanted to set a time to move copy all the records to slave at that particular point of time. Is it possible ? If so , could you please give a brief about it ?]]></description>

I&#039;ve now moved to MongoDB and so you may have better luck checking with the MySQL forum.

					<description><![CDATA[Nice replication steps. My question is, I do have a replication set up (master/slave). I stopped the replication as per managers request and dropped the replication user. Now, I have to set up replication again, do I have to restart the server since binlog has been enabled already?

(Unless using MysQL Cluster) replication is normally in one direction: Master (server A) -&gt; Slave (server B). In this scenario, any write that was made to a slave would not make it back to the master. You &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; also make server A be a slave of server B but it is then the applications responsibility that there are no conflicting writes (e.g. don&#039;t update the same rows on different servers).
