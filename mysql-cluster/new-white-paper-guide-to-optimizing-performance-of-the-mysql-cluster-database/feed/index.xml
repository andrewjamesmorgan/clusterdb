Hi John,

 I don&#039;t have any material comparing the products but the fundamental technology differences are:

 - Oracle RAC is a shared-everything Clustering solution; the up-side is that every node in
   the cluster can see all of the data which may help when you have a query that needs to
   traverse all of the data. The downside is that the shared storage can be more expensive
   and recovery from failures may take longer.
 - MySQL Cluster is shared-nothing. The advantage is that you can scale-out with low cost
   hardware and recovery from failures is &lt;strong&gt;extremely &lt;/strong&gt;fast. Downsides
   are that complex joins can be slow as the data is distributed amongst the data nodes.
 - TimesTen is most typically used as a cache sitting between the application and an 
   Oracle database. TT (at least the last time I checked) doesn&#039;t scale horizontally

Regards, Andrew.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Does Sun have information regarding comparison of MySQL vs. Oracle and TimesTen DB Clustering?

Do you know of any independent evaluations that could be helpful for comparison purpose?]]></description>
