					<description><![CDATA[HI Andrew,

have you tried measuring performance of tables created with &quot;SET ndb_table_no_logging=1;&quot; VS &quot;regular&quot; tables? We conducted many read/write tests with large number of keys and got almost identical results. That is strange, since we are expecting memory tables to be significantly faster.

Best regards,
Mika]]></description>

Thanks for your question. I&#039;m no longer directly involved with MySQL (I&#039;m now with MongoDB) and so I&#039;d suggest that you seek help from &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.mysql.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://forums.mysql.com/&lt;/a&gt;.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Andrew,

If I would like to mirror a full disk-based mysql database entirelyto memory (for read purposes only, that is if the system reboots it would have to sync the full DB back to ram again).

- Is this possible with MySQL?
- How would this work? is it a complex venture on uncharted terrain :-)?
- Is there a high price to pay in overhead (ie. write - the variable cost of syncing write on the disk-based db to memory, the initial cost of fully rebuilding a say 5 GB db in memory.)

greetings,

Coen]]></description>

If you&#039;re using the MEMORY table then it is not really a Cluster table and will be local to the mysqld where you created. Set the engine to NDBCLUSTER to have it visible from all MySQL Servers.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Andrew,

I am trying to set up an in-memory table in a  mysql cluster. I used 

CREATE TABLE City_test_new1 (id INT, INDEX USING HASH (id)) ENGINE=MEMORY as SELECT *  FROM City_test;

Will this be replicated across the cluster? How can I verify?

regards,
Lakshmi]]></description>

Correct - by default, you can lose up to 2 seconds of writes (that haven&#039;t yet made it to the redo log files). Note that from Cluster 7.2 we support splitting the Cluster between sites and so you could split a node group between data centres so that you don&#039;t have an outage if one site loses all power.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi
I have seen the below statement in MySQL cluster document 

&#062;&#062;B.10.19: In the event of a catastrophic failure—say, for instance, the whole city loses power and my UPS fails—would I lose all my data?

All committed transactions are logged. Therefore, although it is possible that some data could be lost in the event of a catastrophe, this should be quite limited. Data loss can be further reduced by minimizing the number of operations per transaction. (It is not a good idea to perform large numbers of operations per transaction in any case.)&#060;&#060;

But is this correct?. MySQL cluster transactions commit the data in to the memory and write the data into the  log is asynchronous to improve the write performance. So if the total cluster failure happened after  the Commit in the memory and befo asynchronous write in to the log file, we will lose that transaction. Am I correct in saying that?

Regards
Anil]]></description>
