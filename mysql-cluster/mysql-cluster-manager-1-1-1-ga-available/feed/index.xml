Adding 2 hosts to the same site is straight-forward, you just repeat the &lt;code&gt;CREATE CLUSTER&lt;/code&gt; command and then make sure that you don&#039;t have conflicting resources (for example, use the SET command to make sure that &lt;code&gt;port&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;portnumber&lt;/code&gt; are distinct for nodes on the same host. I just tried this and it works fine.

Adding hosts to an existing site should also work - I&#039;ve just tested it and it worked fine. Is &lt;code&gt;mcmd&lt;/code&gt; running on the new host (note that if you cloned the new host from one of the others then make sure you delete the mcm_data directory from it otherwise MCM will get confused and the &lt;code&gt;mcmd&lt;/code&gt; may stop). I tested &lt;code&gt;ADD HOST&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code&gt;mcmd&lt;/code&gt; running on the new host and got exactly the behaviour you describe.]]></description>

Hi Andrew,

Actually , we are currently testing MCM and exploring the various administrative tasks. 

As of now there is no requirement. 

Can you also tell me how we can add two clusters in one site? As when I am trying to add hosts prompt is getting hung. When I am taking another mcm client session, its showing host as added, status available but version unknown.

Regards,
Kevin]]></description>

Hi Kevin,

 at the moment there is no option in MCM to remove nodes from the Cluster. For Cluster itself, removing data nodes is a tricky process as it isn&#039;t an on-line operation and involves performing a backup, shutdown, start-up and restore. We find that while &quot;elastic scaling&quot; is a popular idea, the reality is that Cluster users only ever seem to need to scale out and not back in again. Do you have a scale-in requirement/use-case?

Don&#039;t know a lot about the federated storage engine - what would you do to enable it if you weren&#039;t using MCM?

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks much for the response.

I shouldn&#039;t see any issues in that case. I will know more this week when i do the install. 

Thanks Again.

Hi Stalin,

 In terms of communications:
  - The MCM agents must all be able to talk to each other
  - The MCM agents running on the same host as the ndb_mgmd nodes must be able communicate with their local ndb_mgmds over the management &#039;wire protocol&#039;
  - The MCM agents on all hosts must be able to start and stop local processes

					<description><![CDATA[Andrew,

Thanks for giving a quick refresher on MCM. It helps people like me, who is new to MySQL world.

Is possible to run CM agents on different subnet than cluster processes?  I&#039;m in the process of setting up 8 nodes cluster on 7.2 CGE. Each hosts have 2 separate VLANs/subnets, app-db and mgmt respectively. We wanted use mgmt VLAN to manage the cluster including setting up SQL enterprise monitor agents to monitor cluster and send data to management repository running in a separate node in the management network. App-db VLAN will be primarily used for apps to talk to MySQLd nodes.

If this not supported, any input on how to workaround this setup?

Thanks,
Stalin]]></description>
