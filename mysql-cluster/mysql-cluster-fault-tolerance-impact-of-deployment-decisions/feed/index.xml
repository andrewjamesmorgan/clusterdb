Hi Andrew,

I can&#039;t find any documentation on changing nodegroup assignments, and nothing but crickets over on the mysql-ndb IRC channel. Do you have any information on my question above?

Thank you]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent article, which helped me understand why my cluster shuts down when losing 1 node group. I figured one surviving node group held all the data, and they replicated between each group. Wrong.

I realized after reading that I painted myself into a corner. I have put 2 ndb nodes from a single node group (#1) on one vmware server. If the vmware server goes down, I lose that entire node group (#1). The remaining node group (#0) residing on separate physical servers knows it&#039;s lost both members of the node group #1, and therefore shuts down.

My question is, can I safely reassign the ndb nodes so that only one of the VMware hosted nodes is in group #1, and the other in #0? Or will attempting to reassign the ndb nodes to different node groups cause a big problem?

Thanks for any input you can provide.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;./../mysql-cluster-fault-tolerance-impact-of-deployment-decisions/index.html#comment-647484&quot;&gt;andrew&lt;/a&gt;.

To be sure, on one EC2 instance (assuming I have enough resources) I can install the SQL node + the Data node + the MGMT node.
On another EC2 instance (assuming I have enough resources) I can install the SQL node + the Data node + the MGMT node.
So I have two instances that are part of the same node group. My cluster is active / active.

If the first instance or one of the nodes (eg. Data node) installed on it crashes then I have no loss of service because instance 2 is still active. Right?

In the MySQL documentation, it is written that this type of installation is acceptable for a development environment but is not recommended for a production environment. I would like to understand why because I see no single point of failure.

Thanks again for your precious help.]]></description>

You can run multiple nodes on the same server (assuming there are enough resources) &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; if you have just 2 servers then the whole cluster will shutdown if one of the servers is lost (as there must be at least half of the data nodes present in order to stay up).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,

I would like to know if we can install the three nodes (SQL, Data and MGMT) on the same server.
Here are the two scenarios I am currently evaluating:

In this scenario, we have 6 servers. The installation is done in a cloud environment AWS.
Availability zone 1                         Availability zone 2
SQL Node 1                                   SQL Node 2
Data Node 1  --- replication ---  Data Node 2
MGMT node 1                               MGMT node 2

In this scenario, we have 2 servers. The installation is done in a cloud environment AWS.
Availability zone 1                           Availability zone 2
SQL +Data + MGMT Nodes 1        SQL +Data + MGMT Nodes 2
1 server (= 1 instance EC2)            1 server (= 1 instance EC2)

I read that it was not recommended to install the nodes on the same server but I did not find an explanation on why it should not be done especially in the type of scenario above.

For information, I am not a DBA.

Thank you for your help.]]></description>

The only thing I can think of is to start writing your data into an INNODB table - that is still stored locally in the mysqld (and so of course, can&#039;t be seen by ay of the other mysqlds).]]></description>

Thanks. Great help.
Is there any solution to inserting data into MySQL server in order to prevent data losing until the connection restore again?!]]></description>

If the table in question is using the MySQL Cluster storage engine (&lt;code&gt;ENGINE = NDB&lt;/code&gt; when creating the table) then all of the data is stored in the data nodes and so if the mysqld loses contact with the data nodes then the table can not be read from or written to.]]></description>
