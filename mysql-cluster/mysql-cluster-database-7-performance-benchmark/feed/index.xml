InnoDB has all of the data held within a single machine and further, all of the working data set might be cached in memory - that makes it pretty efficient to run complex queries. On the other hand, MySQL Cluster distributes the data over multiple machines and so there is messaging that has to happen between those machines to satisfy queries - if not optimised correctly then the more complex the query, the more messaging and the higher the latency. This can result in queries being slower on Cluster than on InnoDB. Note that Cluster is more focussed on being able to scale out throughput by adding extra nodes vs. the scale-up approach with InnoDB.

As with any storage engine, there are of course techniques to improve throughput and latency - here are a couple of good resources to get you started...

MySQL Cluster is very different from most clustering solutions in that it&#039;s a distributed, shared nothing architecture and so there&#039;s no need for shared storage. 

While fairly easy to manage, it doesn&#039;t have a management GUI an so you have some typing to do. It is further simplified if you use MySQL Cluster Manager (available for a free 30 day trial from edlivery.oracle.com).

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Andrew,

Recently we are going to deploy MySQL 5.5 but we have lack of knowledge and understanding about this new Product.I have some questions about this if you can 

-Is this MySQL Cluster works as Oracle RAC or Microsoft SQL Server

-What do you suggest against if we go for the Red Hat Cluster vs MySQL Cluster 

-Is this easily Manage as Microsoft Cluster

Thanks in advanced

Gratitude,
Syed Jahanzaib]]></description>
