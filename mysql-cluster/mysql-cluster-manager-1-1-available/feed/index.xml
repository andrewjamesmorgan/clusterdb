Hi DaniÃ«l,

 thanks for pointing out those problems - links should be working correctly now. I&#039;ve also updated the footer - only took me 9 months!

 Workbench plugin for MySQL Cluster Manager - that&#039;s a great idea, we&#039;ve not communicated anything in our roadmap yet but it would make sense to have it at some point. Of course, one of the beauties of MySQL Workbench is that anyone can develop a plugin for it. Officially only the mysql client is currently supported but it is the regular mysql protocol between that client and the agent and so anything talking that protocol should be able to issue management commands (&lt;strong&gt;Note &lt;/strong&gt;added 5 Nov 2010) that we know that Connector/J doesn&#039;t work for this).

Best Regards, Andrew.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

The links to &quot;MySQL Cluster Manager 1.1 Demo Video&quot; and &quot;MySQL Cluster (including Manager) Documentation&quot; are not working as expected.

Nice blog post and a very nice way of implementing it :)

Any plans of making MySQL Workbench plugins for the Cluster Manager?

In the footer of the site there is a reference to Sun Microsystems. Shouldn&#039;t that be Oracle now?

Regards,

DaniÃ«l]]></description>
