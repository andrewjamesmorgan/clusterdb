Hi Nilesh,

 unless you&#039;re using MySQL Cluster, each MySQL Server can only have a single master. If you need to simulate multiple masters then you can write a script which over time switches from one master to another (using CHANGE MASTER command).

Regards, Andrew.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Andrew,

Thank your for your response.

I am using Regular MySql.

And soory, I forgotted that All till have local database and when any till will active with Brnach&#039;s Master database than Till database should be replicate with Brnach&#039;s master database. 

Also Branch Database is also in replication with other branches and Head office.

So if you have sample code than please give me that and also please let me know which wat I can replicate this topology.

Hope this information will be ok for you to assist me.

Thanks in Advance.]]></description>

Hi Nils,

 Firstly - is this using MySQL Cluster or &#039;regular&#039; MySQL Servers?

 In either case it should be pretty straight-forward as there is no issue with a single master having multiple slaves. Just have the tills connect as slaves to the local branch master.

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Andrew,

I need one help from you. Please can you help me to resolve replication with following topology.

I want to implement replication in MySQL.

My topology for replication are as below:

I have different branch and all branches are have different database and they are replicate with each other. This way replication I have done with my current system.

But now I want to replicate branch&#039;s database to different till&#039;s database  connected with it.

For example: I have branches: Ho, B1, B2, B3.

Currently I have done replication is following flow: Ho-&#062;B1, B1-&#062; B2, B2-&#062;B3, B3-&#062;Ho and its working fine.

But now I want to replicate My branch database to tills database connected with it.
So for example: I have 3 Tills at Branch B1 than Brnach and Head Office should work as above scenarios but My Brnach B1 should replicate like

B1 - &#062; Till 1, B1- &#062; Till 2 , B1-&#062; Till 3.

And same for other brnach having till than branch&#039;s main Database will replicate with Till database.

But HO and Branches repliaction should work as currently working scenarios as above.

Please let me how I can work with such a scenarios. 

Thanks in Advance.]]></description>
