Hi Al,

 there is an issue with the 7.2.8 Windows package in that it doesn&#039;t contain the ClusterJ jars! You&#039;ve a couple of options:

1) Wait for 7.2.9
2) Extract the jars from the 7.2.8 Linux package (they should work just as well on Windows).

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! I&#039;m doing a school project on fault tolerance and have setup a small database cluster using MySQL Cluster 7.2.8, by following the guide provided on the mysql website: http://downloads.mysql.com/tutorials/cluster/GetMySQLClusterRunning-Windows.pdf

While I can create and update tables using the mysql command line client provided, I&#039;ve been trying to perform these operations from a Java application and came across your tutorials on using ClusterJ and ClusterJPA.

I tried to follow the instructions from http://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/mccj-getting.html#mccj-getting-build-install to get the .jar files so that I could follow your tutorial, but I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m a complete novice at this and am unable to see how to &#039;configure the build to include ClusterJPA and ClusterJ support&#039; when the current cluster I have didn&#039;t seem to have been set up with this build step. It didn&#039;t require any installation or command-line configuration, I just unzipped the download directly to my C:/ drive and created the appropriate my.cnf and config.ini files. I tried checking the /share folder after my cluster was running (hoping that meant it had been installed properly) but it did not contain a mysql/java folder, only multiple folders titled with the names of languages.

Do you know how I can get the appropriate .jar files from MySQL Cluster 7.2.8? Or any other places where I could download them directly? I&#039;m really sorry for bothering you with this question but I haven&#039;t been able to find any solutions elsewhere and you seem very knowledgeable about the MySQL Cluster.

Thank you very much. Apologies for all the inconvenience caused.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;./../mysql-cluster-7-2-8-released/index.html#comment-633&quot;&gt;dpk&lt;/a&gt;.

Upgrades isn&#039;t the most documented process for MySQL Cluster but it&#039;s fairly straight-forward. Simply stop each process and then restart it using the new binary. By restarting one process at a time, the database stays up through the whole process. You should upgrade the management nodes first,  data nodes second and then finally the MySQL Servers.

					<description><![CDATA[Do you know of a MySQL Cluster upgrade guide? Specifically, a guide to upgrading to a new minor release (7.2.6 to 7.2.8)? I think we may be affected by a bug fixed in 7.2.8.]]></description>
