The binary and source versions of MySQL Cluster 7.4.5 have now been made available at <a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/" target="_blank">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/cluster/</a>.</p>
<h2>Release notes</h2>
<p>MySQL Cluster NDB 7.4.5 is a new maintenance release of MySQL Cluster, based on MySQL Server 5.6 and including features from version 7.4 of the NDB storage engine, as well as fixing a number of recently discovered bugs in previous MySQL Cluster releases. </p>
<p>This release also incorporates all bugfixes and changes made in previous MySQL Cluster releases, as well as all bugfixes and feature changes which were added in mainline <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-23.html" title="MySQL 5.6.23 Release Notes" target="_blank">MySQL 5.6 through MySQL 5.6.23</a>.</p>
<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>
<ul>

<p>
        It was found during testing that problems could arise when the<br />
        node registered as the arbitrator disconnected or failed during<br />
        the arbitration process.
      </p>
<p>
        In this situation, the node requesting arbitration could never<br />
        receive a positive acknowledgement from the registered<br />
        arbitrator; this node also lacked a stable set of members and<br />
        could not initiate selection of a new arbitrator.
      </p>
<p>
        Now in such cases, when the arbitrator fails or loses contact<br />
        during arbitration, the requesting node immediately fails rather<br />
        than waiting to time out.<br />
       (Bug #20538179)</p>

        The maximum failure time calculation used to ensure that normal<br />
        node failure handling mechanisms are given time to handle<br />
        survivable cluster failures (before global checkpoint watchdog<br />

        <code class="literal">LCP_FRAG_ORD</code> signal with its<br />
        <code class="literal">lastFragmentFlag</code> set even after the local<br />
        checkpoint has been completed. This enhancement causes this flag<br />
        to persist until the statrt of the next local checkpoint, which<br />
        causes these signals to be dropped as well.

        copying of fragments. However, this is not the case in a system<br />
        restart, where a master node can have stale data and so need to<br />
        perform such copying to bring itself up to date.<br />

        A scan operation, whether it is a single table scan or a query<br />
        scan used by a pushed join, stores the result set in a buffer.<br />
        This maximum size of this buffer is calculated and preallocated<br />
        before the scan operation is started. This buffer may consume a<br />
        considerable amount of memory; in some cases we observed a 2 GB<br />
        buffer footprint in tests that executed 100 parallel scans with<br />
        2 single-threaded (<span class="command"><strong>ndbd</strong></span>) data nodes. This<br />
        memory consumption was found to scale linearly with additional<br />
        fragments.
      </p>
<p>
        A number of root causes, listed here, were discovered that led<br />
        to this problem:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle">
<li class="listitem">
<p>
            Result rows were unpacked to full<br />
            <a class="ulink" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/ndbapi/en/ndb-ndbrecord.html" target="_top"><code class="literal">NdbRecord</code></a> format before<br />
            they were stored in the buffer. If only some but not all<br />
            columns of a table were selected, the buffer contained empty<br />
            space (essentially wasted).
          </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
            Due to the buffer format being unpacked,<br />
            <a class="ulink" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/char.html" target="_top"><code class="literal">VARCHAR</code></a> and<br />
            <a class="ulink" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/binary-varbinary.html" target="_top"><code class="literal">VARBINARY</code></a> columns always had<br />
            to be allocated for the maximum size defined for such<br />
            columns.
          </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>
            <a class="ulink" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-api-definition.html#ndbparam-api-batchbytesize" target="_top"><code class="literal">BatchByteSize</code></a> and<br />
            <a class="ulink" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-api-definition.html#ndbparam-api-maxscanbatchsize" target="_top"><code class="literal">MaxScanBatchSize</code></a><br />
            values were not taken into consideration as a limiting<br />
            factor when calculating the maximum buffer size.
          </p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
        These issues became more evident in NDB 7.2 and later MySQL<br />
        Cluster release series. This was due to the fact buffer size is<br />
        scaled by <a class="ulink" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-cluster-api-definition.html#ndbparam-api-batchsize" target="_top"><code class="literal">BatchSize</code></a>, and<br />
        that the default value for this parameter was increased fourfold<br />
        (from 64 to 256) beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 7.2.1.
      </p>
<p>
        This fix causes result rows to be buffered using the packed<br />
        format instead of the unpacked format; a buffered scan result<br />
        row is now not unpacked until it becomes the current row. In<br />
        addition, <code class="literal">BatchByteSize</code> and<br />
        <code class="literal">MaxScanBatchSize</code> are now used as limiting<br />
        factors when calculating the required buffer size.
      </p>
<p>
        Also as part of this fix, refactoring has been done to separate<br />
        handling of buffered (packed) from handling of unbuffered result<br />
        sets, and to remove code that had been unused since NDB 7.0 or<br />
        earlier. The <code class="literal">NdbRecord</code> class declaration has<br />
        also been cleaned up by removing a number of unused or redundant<br />
        member variables.<br />
       (Bug #73781, Bug #75599, Bug #19631350, Bug #20408733)</p>

<ul>
<li>Important Note: It is possible in MySQL Cluster NDB 7.0.6 and later   to perform online upgrades from MySQL Cluster NDB 6.3.8 and later MySQL   Cluster NDB 6.3 releases, or from MySQL Cluster NDB 7.0.5 or later MySQL Cluster NDB 7.0 releases.</li>
<li>It was not possible to perform an online upgrade from any MySQL Cluster  NDB 6.x release to MySQL Cluster NDB 7.0.5 or any to earlier MySQL Cluster NDB 7.0 release. (Bug#44294)</li>
<li>The ndb_config utility program can now provide an offline dump of all MySQL Cluster configuration parameters including information such as default and permitted values, brief description, and applicable section of the config.ini file.</li>
